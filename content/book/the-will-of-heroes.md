## Core Concepts

### The Three Powers of Will
1. **Will Power** - The power to do what you need to do
2. **Won't Power** - The power to resist what you shouldn't do  
3. **Want Power** - The power connected to your purpose and long-term goals

### The Willpower Muscle
- Willpower is like a muscle that can be strengthened
- It can also be depleted (ego depletion)
- Requires proper fuel (good glucose, sleep, exercise)

### Primitive Brain vs. Modern Brain
- Primitive brain seeks immediate gratification
- Modern brain (prefrontal cortex) handles long-term planning
- The battle between short-term temptation and long-term goals

### The Zones Model
1. **Comfort Zone** - Where we feel safe but don't grow
2. **Learning Zone** - Where growth happens
3. **Chaos Zone** - Too far outside comfort, leads to shutdown

### The Planning Fallacy
- We consistently underestimate how long things take
- Solution: Reference class forecasting
- Break large goals into smaller, measurable pieces

### Small Wins
- Build confidence through incremental victories
- Each small win creates momentum for the next
- The "Snowball Effect" of compounding success

### Deliberate Practice
- Not just repetition, but focused improvement
- Requires feedback and adjustment
- 10,000 hours concept (from Outliers)
