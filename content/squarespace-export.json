I can make reality as narrow or as wide as I wish\" – Christy Brown \\[[1](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43946.My_Left_Foot)\\]\nIn 1932, Christy Brown was born into a world seemingly stacked against him. Stricken with severe cerebral palsy, he was unable to speak, control his limbs, or express his intellect in any conventional way. Yet, Brown refused to let his **physical limitations** confine his spirit or his mind, proving that **disability does not equate to inability**. \\[[2](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/450659.Christy_Brown_s_Universe)\\]\nBrown's mother, Bridget Brown, was his beacon of hope. She saw the light of intelligence in her son’s eyes, even when doctors proclaimed him a lost cause. Through her unwavering belief in him, she unknowingly paved the way for one of the most remarkable journeys in literary history. This reminds us that **those with disabilities need strong advocates and allies** to break through societal barriers. \\[[3](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/227499.Christy_Brown)\\]\nAt the age of five, Brown made a discovery that would set the course for his future. With great difficulty, he managed to seize a piece of chalk with his left foot, leaving a mark on a slate. This was his **breakthrough**, his first taste of communication. This moment underscores the fact that **every form of communication is valid and that alternative methods can unlock vast potentials**. \\[[4](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43946.My_Left_Foot)\\]\n\"The human spirit is one of ability, perseverance and courage that no disability can steal away\" – Anonymous. \\[[5](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/disability)\\]\n## The Power of Persistence\nWith his newfound tool, Brown began to expand his world. Through painstaking practice and a refusal to accept defeat, he developed his skills. Over time, he started to write, then draw, and eventually paint - all with his left foot. This reiterates that **physical limitations do not limit the power of creativity and expression**. \\[[6](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/227499.Christy_Brown)\\]\nDespite his physical constraints, he found a way to **express himself artistically**. His determination and resourcefulness turned a seemingly impossible situation into a story of hope, resilience, and triumph. This is an inspiring reminder that **even in the face of adversity, disabilities are not inevitable limitations on our ability to create, express ourselves, and make a meaningful difference in the world**. \\[[7](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/450659.Christy_Brown_s_Universe)\\]\nChristy Brown's story serves as a powerful reminder that the human spirit can overcome unimaginable obstacles. It shows us that, with the right mindset and determination, we can transcend our limitations and achieve greatness if we have the strength to follow these principles from his example.\n**Embrace the Power of Persistence**\nChristy Brown's life is a testament to the power of persistence. Despite the challenges he faced, he never gave up on finding ways to express himself. He started using his left foot at the age of five, after 17 years of practice, he was able to actually write a book.\nThis is grit. Is passion and perseverance towards a very specific goal and is a key factor in achieving success and personal growth \\[[8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4211426/)\\]. By embracing persistence in our own lives, we can overcome obstacles and unlock our full potential. I have been without the [ability to use my hands to type since 2017.](http://willpowered.com/learn/the-darkside-of-entrepreneurship) It was not until 2022 that I was able to actually work faster and better than I did when my hands were fully healthy.\nThe amount of time that it takes massive daunting, but sheer persistence in the face of adversity turns the task from outright impossible into achievable.\nAbsolutely. Here's a revision of that section with a focus on the importance of achieving small wins and earning self-confidence:\n**Earn Your Self-Confidence One Small Win At A Time**\nChristy Brown's story of overcoming adversity and achieving extraordinary success is a powerful testament to the importance of self-confidence earned through small, incremental wins. That first time that he picked up the piece of chalk was the small when he needed to foster his self-confidence, instilling in him the belief that he was capable of more.\nBy focusing on his own abilities and celebrating small victories, Brown developed a robust sense of self-confidence that propelled him to further achievements. His journey illustrates the importance of embracing one's capabilities and seeing obstacles not as insurmountable barriers but as challenges to be overcome, one step at a time.\nResearch indicates that success and well-being are closely tied to one's belief in their abilities, **but these beliefs are most beneficial when they are earned through real achievements** \\[[9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4211426/)\\]. According to psychologist Albert Bandura, this concept, known as self-efficacy, is the belief in one's ability to succeed in specific situations or accomplish a task \\[10\\]. Bandura suggests that self-efficacy can influence how one approaches goals, tasks, and challenges.\nFor Christy Brown, his self-confidence, rooted in his initial small win of using his left foot to draw, was the seed that grew into a series of accomplishments, from learning to write and paint with his foot, to eventually becoming a renowned author and painter.\nWhatever journey you are on, seek to accomplish one small win that will get you closer. The small win with my hands was first discovering voice dictation – and realizing I could type faster through speech than on a keyboard. After that, it was one little victory of being able to do things better with voice after another.\n**Never Underestimate the Power of Support**\nChristy Brown's journey would not have been possible without the support of his mother, Bridget Brown, who believed in him when no one else did. Studies show that social support is crucial for psychological well-being and resilience in the face of adversity \\[[10](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2921311/)\\].\nBy surrounding ourselves with supportive people and offering encouragement to those around us, we can foster an environment of growth and success. Humans are the ultimate social species. As much as we want to believe that we can accomplish anything ourselves, we need the help, support, guidance, and feedback of those around us.\nWhether you have a strong support network already, or you need to build one from scratch, understand that you cannot do this alone. If seeking friendship and support seems daunting, please check out [my introvert's guide to making new friends and deepening relationships.](http://willpowered.com/learn/an-introverts-guide-to-making-new-friends-and-deepening-relationships)\n## Conclusion\nThe story of Christy Brown is an inspiring reminder of the power of the human spirit. By applying the lessons of persistence, small wins, and the importance of support in our own lives, we can overcome challenges and reach our full potential.\nJust like Christy Brown, we can transform adversity into opportunities for growth and make a meaningful impact on the world around us. His story serves as a beacon of hope for people with disabilities, proving that physical limitations are no match for the strength of the human spirit.\nIf you are down in your own life, search for the one thing going well. What is your \"left foot?\" How can you leverage that strength or skill to overcome your challenges and achieve your goals?\nRemember, no accomplishment is too small to celebrate, and **every step forward, no matter how minor it may seem, brings you closer to creating a meaningful impact on your life, your family, and this world.**\n**Sources:**\n\\[[1](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43946.My_Left_Foot)\\] My Left Foot by Christy Brown\n\\[[2](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/450659.Christy_Brown_s_Universe)\\] Christy Brown's Universe: An Analysis of the Novels by Georgina Louise Hamblin\n\\[[3](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/227499.Christy_Brown)\\] Christy Brown: The Life that Inspired My Left Foot by Georgina Louise Hamblin\n\\[[4](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/43946.My_Left_Foot)\\] My Left Foot by Christy Brown\n\\[[5](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/tag/disability)\\] Goodreads disability quotes\n\\[[6](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/227499.Christy_Brown)\\] Christy Brown: The Life that Inspired My Left Foot by Georgina Louise Hamblin\n\\[[7](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/450659.Christy_Brown_s_Universe)\\] Christy Brown's Universe: An Analysis of the Novels by Georgina Louise Hamblin\n\\[[8](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4211426/)\\] The role of grit in college student health care management skills and health-related quality of life\n\\[[9](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2921311/)\\] Bandura, A.

This is the second part of my story about why I can no longer use my hands to navigate my phone, drive a car, or type the words you are reading now.\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5416af3ce4b0f910e3133ead/aa512b5f-e17f-43e5-a62d-6a74161fe18c/457B96D3-86FD-4F7F-A749-C0F3AD6DD934.jpeg)\nPhoto by [Mika Korhonen](https://unsplash.com/@mikakor?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText) on [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=unsplash&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=creditCopyText)\n**At the spot we pick up in my story, I had successfully** [**published my book**](https://www.amazon.com/Will-Heroes-Greatness-Robertson-2016-02-26/dp/B01FKT2WKQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8)**. Yet, my blog and book audiences simply weren’t big enough and my debt continued to grow. My hands were also in serious need of treatment but I continued to defer it.**\nAs you’ve likely gathered by this point, I’m not one to give up easily. So, I decided to think bigger and explore ways to make my business successful.\n# Spreading scientific knowledge\nAt this point, I had written about the research of neuroscientists, psychologists, and other experts that had decades of experience in their field. But after all of the heartache and pain writing had caused me, it was clear that this alone was not enough to make a valuable difference in people's lives.\nThe more I explored the topic, the more I realized that willpower is such a small part of what is possible to achieve through science. Top researchers in the fields of health, wellness, performance, neuroscience, etc. were also trying to get their research understood by regular people. At the same time, it was now 2016 and misinformation abounded.\nAs I assessed my situation, I noticed that I had:\n-   A growing audience\n-   Increasing marketing knowledge \n-   Little credibility\n-   A lack of scientific expertise\nWhen it came to experts, there were plenty of people out there with:\n-   Significant credibility \n-   Plenty of scientific expertise\n-   Little to no skills in marketing\n-   A lack of understanding how to monetize their knowledge \nAs my last gasp to keep my dream alive, I decided to get in touch with these experts from around the world and **see if we could work together to spread scientific knowledge further.**\nAfter reaching out to dozens of the experts that I respected the most, I was delighted that many of them were interested in working with me.\n[Educo Community](https://educocommunity.com/) was born. The focus of Educo, an online learning platform, was to help people put expert knowledge into action and achieve whatever greatness they seek.\n[\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5416af3ce4b0f910e3133ead/ba2fc17f-cb51-4b09-bbdc-d35e008eb08d/FB9603E4-F2D0-4F78-91F2-F44367C5F099.jpeg)\n](https://educocommunity.com/p/home)\nAs I gathered interest from the scientific community, I reached out to friends and family about investing in the Educo Community business model. I raised enough money to keep the lights on for the next six months.\nYet again, I found myself working long, hard hours for just enough money to pay the rent. **I was going to ask even more of my hands without any money or time to repair them.**\nMy right hand could no longer bear it. I wore a splint throughout the day. I could still type…barely—and I used my left hand as much as possible to give my right hand a break.\nThis was completely unsustainable. If I wanted to get work done, I needed to start thinking about other options. So, I searched Google for any alternative I could find to use a computer without my hands. The best option I found was voice.\n# Becoming a voice control early adopter\nIn 2016, voice control consisted primarily of dictation…**and the technology didn’t work very well.**\nI was able to send emails and do a little bit of writing, but that was about it. In practice, it was actually more frustrating to use my voice than it was painful to type with a brace.\nHowever, as time went on and I became more and more reliant on using my voice, technology and applications began to improve.\nIn fact, **I began to see that there were some benefits in my predicament**. It was slow and frustrating to do most tasks, but I could actually [teach my Mac a wide variety of voice commands](http://willpowered.com/learn/double-creativity-productivity-through-scarcity) that sped things up.\nOver the course of trying to get Educo Community off the ground, I was also finding more and more ways to get my work done with voice control technology.\nEventually, I felt like I reached a point where I could put my right wrist in a sling and do everything with my left hand and voice. _Maybe this would give my right hand the break that it needed in order to heal._\nThis was a terrible decision. Putting my right hand in a sling meant that I was **using my left hand for everything**.\nAt first, it felt like this was working. My left hand was still strong enough to do most tasks and I was able to get a lot accomplished with my voice. My goal was to keep this up for a month. I figured this was enough time for my right wrist to heal and get back to normal. None of this came from a doctor or medical professional. It was me trying to solve all my problems on my own.\nAfter two weeks, it looked like I was going to be OK. The pain in my right hand was going down significantly and I felt like it might heal completely soon. Yet just a few days later, the pain in my left hand worsened. It started feeling just as bad as my right one.\nAs this was happening, I realized that my right hand wasn't healed enough to get back into action. It had healed a lot, but it had also grown a lot weaker. I would need physical therapy to build strength in my right hand and ease back into typing again. \nI couldn't type with my right hand. I couldn't type with my left hand. And, voice control was not yet at a place where I could rely on it without using my hands at all.\nAnd yet, I still had a massive job to get done and my cash was dwindling. Plus, now I wasn't just risking my own money. Some of my closest friends and family invested in me and **I could not let them down**.\nTo get through the day and try to get Educo Community off the ground, I got a brace for my left hand as well. **This was it**. A wake up call. I looked down at both of my hands covered in braces, unable to perform any normal functions without at least a little bit of pain.\nStill, I didn't seek professional help. In retrospect, I cannot believe the irony. Here I was, working with experts on a regular basis trying to figure out a way to communicate their work to the public. Yet, rather than seek the help of an expert in treating my hands, I was just relying on my own judgment.\n> **“I was so narrowly focused on keeping my dream alive that I could not muster the self-awareness to take a step back.”**\nAt this point I had poured so much of my blood, sweat and tears into my dream of helping individuals use the tools of science to unlock the greatness within them that I felt like I could not give up now. I was always asking my mind and my body for a little bit more. \n**I kept believing that success was just a few months away.** Even with braces on both of my wrists, I was determined to figure out a way to make Educo Community a reality.\n# Building a voice technology toolbox\nAs I looked at those braces on both my hands, a thought occurred to me:\n_I am truly lucky to be living in this time._\nI'm not working on pipes, in a factory, or in any position where I need to use my hands all day. I wondered…does the work I'm doing require the use of my hands at all?\nThe human hand is a marvelous tool. But it is not as marvelous as the human brain. I had the wealth of all human knowledge available to me on the internet and early tools that could help me accomplish the work I needed to. I resolved to use my brain to figure out how to get my work done without my hands.\nAt this point, I couldn't type on a keyboard, but I could at least tap on an iPad. Something about the hand movements of an iPad made it easier for me to get work done.\nIn 2017, iPads still weren't good enough to build websites, create and edit videos, or do many of the other things I needed to do in order to get Educo Community off the ground. So, I looked for a tool that would allow me to operate my Mac using my iPad.\n**There were two gems that I stumbled upon:**\n1.  # **Alfred**\n[\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5416af3ce4b0f910e3133ead/d02fb839-1f3b-4098-b212-12cae2d4e771/607A3C6F-CE1B-4777-BB1F-40BE3DC0C4AC.jpeg)\n](https://www.alfredapp.com)\n[Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/) is a really simple way to teach commands to your Mac. You can use it to go to websites, open emails, or perform certain commands like copy/paste and shut down in just one tap.\nAlfred Remote is a feature that allows you to run all of these commands right from your iPad. Here are some examples:\nWith Alfred, I could go to a website with just one tap. This replaced the usual steps:\n1.  Moving the mouse to my web browser \n2.  Pointing and clicking\n3.  Typing in the website\n4.  Pressing enter\nIt may not sound like much, but my hands were in rough shape. And every tap counted. But, I needed more than what Alfred could offer. With Alfred, I still had to point and click using my Mac. I also could not type through the Alfred application. So I had to use the Mac dictation tool, which was terrible. It only picked up 60 to 70 percent of the words I said correctly…if it even realized that I was trying to dictate at all. \nI had to constantly reset it and I tried all kinds of different mics to try to achieve on a Mac what I could on an iPhone or iPad. I needed a way to use that superior dictation tool to type on my Mac. In addition, I needed to be able to point and click by tapping on my iPad rather than using a mouse.\n# 2\\. BetterTouchTool\n[\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5416af3ce4b0f910e3133ead/6336a061-36de-4447-9bdb-1ad5a5774f40/886325AD-84BC-4982-9CD7-F51ECDF8865A.jpeg)\n](https://folivora.ai)\nAfter searching long and hard I came across the perfect solution: [BetterTouchTool.](https://bettertouchtool.en.softonic.com/mac)\nThis was a tool sent from heaven. Below you will see a screenshot of my iPad. The area highlighted is one giant trackpad that allows you to move the mouse on your Mac by gesturing on your iPad.\nEven better, the benefits didn't stop there.Tapping this area highlighted below allowed me to bring up my iPad keyboard and use it to enter subsequent words into my Mac. This also allowed me to use the iPad dictation feature for my Mac.\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5416af3ce4b0f910e3133ead/1512d618-25ee-4914-9b36-dfa1025a31cb/0B82B583-FF66-4D15-AF35-33BE7A8D2D4C.jpeg)\nMoreover, it had a sidebar with customized commands:\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5416af3ce4b0f910e3133ead/0080e4d3-3f76-4bbd-8c1c-1e0aa3390460/4F309CC1-2821-4849-9F13-171965C2A6B3.jpeg)\nWhile BetterTouchTool was quite buggy then, it has gotten better and better over time. With these tools in hand, I gained the ability to create a website, online courses and apps while resting my hands. Now, I just needed to find the right experts to be a part of the Educo Community.\n# TED talks, experts, and a new learning community\n**When I first started considering how to market the work of scientists and experts, I quickly realized there wasn’t a clear path.** Some had a successful book at one point, but did not have much of an audience today. If I had learned one lesson from my failures to this point, it was the importance of an audience.\nI needed experts with an audience. I also needed a way to of vetting the authenticity of the experts I would feature. **The obvious solution to these two objectives showed up consistently in my YouTube feed:** [**TED**](https://www.ted.com/talks)**.** Millions of people watch Ted talks every single day. Many of them are inspired by the subject matter expert and want to follow the advice given in the talk.\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5416af3ce4b0f910e3133ead/0cfbfef8-e617-4987-ac3c-288849fd855c/63C8B501-20AA-429F-B4E9-FC1B1F1D59DA.jpeg)\nDespite viewers’ best intentions to follow the advice in any given video, it was only a matter of time before they moved on to other videos, other tasks, other work, and **completely forgot about what the speaker specifically recommended.**\n**_What if I could work with the speakers on a way to help their audience take action through online courses and programs?_**\nThis would improve the experience for the speaker by expanding the reach of their speech and growing their audience further. Equally important, It would improve the experience for the user, better equipping them to take action on the advice in the talk and use it to improve their lives.\nThirdly, it would improve the experience for TED, which had to rely on sponsorships and advertising in order to fund their organization. If we worked together, perhaps this new business model could replace their need to rely on advertising. To me, this was a win-win all around.\nNext, I reached out to speakers who I genuinely admired. I was delighted to discover they were interested. After that, I reached out to TED. Although they had some reservations, they were also open to talking.\n**I felt like I had it**. If I built great programs with at least 10 experts, I felt like TED would might run a pilot program to see if we could make this user experience and business model work.\nOnce again, I set myself on that goal. I reached out and signed contracts with 12 TED speakers who believed in the vision. With their help, we got to work building online programs that would help their TED talk audiences apply the advice in the talk. With Alfred remote and BetterTouchTool in hand, I was able to do it…barely. My hands took yet another beating, but I got the job done.\n**I was ready to launch Educo Community to the world.**\n# Defeat\nAt this point you may be wondering if I finally caught a break and succeeded with Educo Community.\nSpoiler: I did not.\nOne primary (and significant) problem was that the whole business model relied on TED and the experts weren’t necessarily connected to their audiences. Like many other experts, these speakers did not have large audiences on their own. Even if they had millions of views, they didn't have millions of email subscribers or Twitter followers.\nBecause of this, TED needed to be on board if we were going to make this thing profitable.\nThis was my absolute last breath. I had no cash left. I had no credit left. I had no friends or family that had not already invested. **Everything came down to this moment. The TED partnership was it.**\nWith Educo launched, I got back in touch with TED to try to finalize a pilot program. Their response? Cold feet. Before they were willing to consider a partnership, they wanted to see proof of interest in the form of at least 1 million users. Educo Community had 1000. There was no chance of closing that gap anytime soon.\nIn retrospect, I think if I pushed them harder, I could have convinced them to do a small scale pilot program. Even if it was only just with one expert. But, **I had no strength left after this latest setback.**\n# **Regroup**\nAfter everything, I needed to regroup. I couldn't do this anymore. There was no cash in the bank and no fuel in my tank. At the very least, my dream needed to be put on hold. With my tail between my legs, I told all of the speakers the bad news. All of the work they had done with me over the past months was for nothing. \nWorse, I now needed to ask them for references. I needed to find some sort of job that would help me start digging out of this hole I had put myself in. Thankfully, [Bill Eckstrom](https://www.linkedin.com/in/billeckstrom)—one of the speakers I worked most closely with and admired the most, connected me with [Josh Berry](https://www.econic.co/josh-berry) and [Econic](http://econic.co/).\n**With braces on both of my hands and nothing but failure on my résumé, Josh gave me a chance.**\n# Recoup\nAfter joining Econic, I was committed to digging myself out of the massive hole I was in. I had more than $35,000 in credit card debt and a huge task ahead of me if I was going to ever heal my hands. I chose to focus on the debt first.\nIt took me a solid two years to pay off all $35,000. But by the end of 2019, I did it. \n**Unfortunately, that meant once again that I put my hands second.** Physical therapy is a huge financial investment. And, I just wanted to get out of all of that debt so I could sleep peacefully again.\nI continued with my hybrid of voice commands, BetterTouchTool and braces on both of my wrists for the full duration of those two years. I was able to get by and do my job, but my hands slowly deteriorated that whole time.\n**In 2020, four years after I first had issues, I finally went into physical therapy. But it may have been too late.**\n# **The reality I live with**\nPhysical therapy helped but I never got close to being fully healed. I made progress, but I had major setbacks along the way. In October 2021, I experienced my worst one yet. The pain in my hand was so bad that it started shaking as I picked up a fork.\nUntil then, the issue was mainly limited to using technology. I could still pick things up, put on my clothes, and do most other every day things that require your hands. This was the first time that the issue extended beyond my work and into my every day life. **I could not continue this way.**\nAt this point, I took a medical leave from Econic and committed myself fully to finally healing my hands. **After months of meeting with specialists with little to show for it, I was finally told that I would likely never be able to type on a keyboard or tap on the phone again.**\n# **Hope**\nAs I write this using the help of voice technology, I’m unable to use my hands to work with technology at all—and I likely never will again.\nYou may be asking: Why is this section titled hope then?!\nDespite my situation, I consider myself truly lucky. I still stand by my revelation back in 2017. In today's world, **you do not need the use of your hands in order to do meaningful work. All you need is your mind.**\nI figured out a way to type the words you are reading now without ever touching a keyboard. I will find a way to do everything else by voice as well.\nDiscovering how to do this will give me—and anyone else who is willing to learn, a huge advantage in the world of tomorrow. **We did not evolve to sit hunched over at a desk all day typing away.** We evolved to communicate by voice. Technology has improved exponentially since I first started using it in 2016. It is only a matter of time before it evolves to a point where everyone is using their voice to create meaningful work.\n**As I continue to navigate this journey, perhaps we can discover the true potential of voice technology together. After all, our mind is continually seeking new ways to solve problems and accomplish meaningful work if we are willing to stay curious, expand our realm of possibilities, and take on hard challenges.**",

      "content": "_Article originally posted on_ [_econic.co_](https://www.econic.co/blog/the-darkside-of-entrepreneurship)_._\nI’m Colin, Entrepreneur in Residence at [Econic](https://www.econic.co/). I'm only 31 years young and I can no longer use my hands to navigate my phone, drive a car, or type the words you are reading right now.\nThis is not due to any medical condition, predisposition, or genetic disability.\n**It is the result of a dark time in my entrepreneurial journey before I joined Econic. A darkness that has left me without the ability to use my hands.**\nYou may have heard the Elon Musk quote, “Running a start-up is like **_chewing glass_** yoand staring into the abyss. After a while, you stop staring, but the glass chewing never ends.”\nIn many ways, I’m still chewing the glass. Conversely, what I’m experiencing has opened my eyes to the future work possibilities that most people have yet to see.\nI imagine you may have some questions so let’s back up.\n# My story\n**How did I get here?** \nAs I stared at two wrist braces on both of my hands, this was the predominant question I sat with. Two years earlier I set out to create a business focused on the science of willpower. Now, it seemed I had taken willpower too far.\n**I have always believed that the human brain is the most marvelous tool in the known universe**. **There is greatness at the center of every human mind that is just waiting to be unlocked.**\nHow to unlock it…is the question I have devoted my life's work to.\nIn 2011, I read absolutely everything I could on the science of mind, how we make decisions, how we form habits, how we summon the courage and do what we need to do to achieve great things in life.\nI used these lessons to get out of my comfort zone as an introvert, achieve success as an athlete, and embrace the fear and anxiety of entrepreneurship.\nThe thing that helped me most through this process was understanding the science of willpower.\n**After almost 4 years of learning and applying the lessons of willpower, I created a website and blog.** I wanted to share what I was learning and how I was using willpower to achieve success as an athlete and entrepreneur.\nIt felt like I had found my purpose: \n_To help individuals use the tools of science to unlock the greatness within their mind and take control of their future._\nTo start, the blog was something I was doing on the side while working full-time as a marketing consultant. Eventually, I saved up enough money and had a big enough subscriber base that I thought I could strike out on my own and work on it full-time.\n**With only three months of cash, I was out of my mind.**\nI had a subscriber base of about 2000 at that point. I believed that learning the science of willpower, applying that to health and business, and sharing my journey and lessons with an audience would be enough to make a living.\nIn the end, it was. **But it came at a terrible cost.**\nA cost that would leave me without the ability to use my hands to type the words you are reading now.\n**Because of this, I’m an early adopter of voice technology. I am beginning to see how using our voices will shape the future of how we work and use computers.**\n# Early Days\nIn 2015, the world was quieter. There wasn't as much content bombarding people every day as there is now. High-quality blog content was read and appreciated by people. And, if you were willing to produce lots and lots and lots of content, you had a shot at making it.\nSo, I committed myself to writing 1000 words every single day. I was hoping my blog would find an audience large enough to generate an income I could live on.\nThe early days started well. I was committed to writing 1000 words per day and I was achieving that goal. **I was learning more about the science of willpower every day, applying that to my work, and sharing that with an audience. An audience that was getting exponentially bigger by the day.** **It was a wonderful feedback loop. Wake left**\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5416af3ce4b0f910e3133ead/53b2c062-70d8-4ea5-9ff2-63205758df6a/Willpowered+Feedback+Loop_Colin+Robertson_Econic.png)\n**I was not making any money yet, but my audience was building and I was growing as a writer.**\nI had a couple of articles go viral like [10 Simple Steps to Strengthen Your Willpower](http://willpowered.com/learn/strengthen-your-willpower) and [How to Influence the Subconscious Mind](http://willpowered.com/learn/how-to-influence-the-subconscious-mind).\n**Two months in, I felt like I was really hitting my stride. But with only one month of cash left, I had to figure out a way to make money.**\nI tried everything. Online courses, selling ads, selling referrals, everything.\nIt wasn't quite enough.\nI was living extremely frugally at the time and set myself a budget of $1500 per month. Combining everything together I was making about $900 a month.\n**So, I decided to go into credit card debt. That's where the problems begin.**\nI told myself that it was only temporary. After all, my audience was growing, I had a couple of articles that were landing high search results, and I was figuring out my voice as a writer. If I can just keep this up, eventually I will be able to make a living.\nSo I kept the feedback loop going: learning about the science of willpower, using those lessons to produce more content, and sharing those lessons with my audience.\n**My audience kept growing, but it seemed like no matter what I tried I just couldn't find a way to monetize the content enough. I was about nine months into trying to make this blog a living and** **the credit card debt continued to mount**.\nNow things started getting really stressful. And, I took more extreme measures to try to keep my business and my dream alive.\n# Kill them with content – not yourself\nI scoured the internet trying to learn absolutely everything I could about how to create a successful content business.\n**Everything I read had a similar message: kill them with content.**\nSo I stepped up my game. I was going to produce as much high-quality content of any kind as I could. I had to. The bills were piling up, and I didn't have a way to pay for them.\n**Creating more content meant spending more time with my computer and less time sleeping. This is where my knowledge and devotion to the science of willpower might not have been the most healthy…**\nAs part of my research, I learned that when you experience fatigue while running, biking, etc. it is not because your muscles are actually getting to a point where they can't keep going. It is because your brain is sending messages to you to slow down in order to conserve resources and energy.\nRemembering this helped me immensely when pushing myself through fatigue on a run or while competing in races. I knew the science and my leg muscles weren't in any danger.\nSo, I applied this logic to typing on a keyboard. I kept trying to create as much content as possible. This meant pushing well beyond the time a person’s hands can healthfully type.\nAll of a sudden, **my positive Willpowered feedback loop turned negative.**\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5416af3ce4b0f910e3133ead/f520acfb-cfd5-4311-9203-44f90e6b18e1/Negative+Willpowered+Feedback+Loop_Colin+Robertson_Econic.png)\n**Now it was increasing credit card debt, needing to create as much content as possible to pay it, and using willpower to push my hands through the pain of typing.**\nEven worse, all of this still wasn't good enough to make a living. **So I decided to take a Hail Mary.** **I would run a** [**Kickstarter campaign**](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/743524537/the-will-of-heroes) **and publish my first book.**\n# Kickstarter\nThe Kickstarter was designed around a book pre-sale that would give me enough runway to write the book, publish it, and hopefully start getting speaking gigs that would allow me to make a living.\n**I had the idea for the book in mind for a long time. I would share the stories of how twelve of the most successful people of all time used their willpower to achieve that success. Explaining the science of willpower along the way.**\n**The Kickstarter spanned one month and the goal was to raise $12,000 to get the book published.** The rules for Kickstarter at the time were that you had to raise all of the money that you needed or you got nothing.\nSo I set that goal and the clock was ticking.\nMore time at my keyboard…\nLess sleep…\nRepeat.\n**With only 10 days left, I hadn't even hit half of my goal yet.**\nI thought I was completely doomed. This was it. It was the end of my dream. **But I was not going to go down without a fight**.\nMore time on my keyboard…\nEven less sleep…\n**By some miracle, I was able to surpass my goal and raise $13,000 in the end.**\n**Unfortunately, this success came at a terrible cost. The damage done to my hands from that experience needed to be repaired.**\n**Only now I had an entire book to write.**\n# Writing the book\nI thought I had finally broken the cycle.\nI had $13,000 in hand to publish a book and really make it as a writer. This was a fantastic opportunity and **I was not going to waste it**.\nThe Kickstarter wrapped up in November 2015 and I had promised all of my backers that the book would be ready by the end of March 2016. That was a tall order to say the least, but $13,000 would only cover food and rent for so long.\nIf I was going to get a book written and ready to publish in that amount of time, I needed to completely eliminate any distractions.\nSo, rather than deal with the Chicago winter, I thought I would kill several birds with one stone by moving to Florida where I would save money on rent and be removed from all distractions.\nShortly after, I moved to Florida and got to work.\n**By this point my hands were not in terrible shape, but they were in no position to write an entire book in addition to blogging twice a week and trying to keep up with creating online courses.**\nI knew at the time I needed to do something to repair them, but I put those thoughts to the side until I published this book. \nAs a published author, I believed I would finally have the credibility and readership that would allow this to become a full-time living.\n**The dream was right there. So close.** \nI just needed to push through whatever pain I would experience in the five months and then I could reap the rewards for the rest of my life. At least that's what I told myself.\nBut, I was exhausted. I tried following absolutely every single lesson about willpower I had written about and learned about over the years.\nI ate a strict no sugar diet…\nI meditated four times a day…\nI went to bed and woke up at the exact same time every single day…\nIt wasn't enough. I was exhausted. I was running on fumes and falling behind on my deadlines. \n**Willpower alone wasn't enough anymore…so I turned to Adderall.**\n# A dark cycle\nAnyone who has ever taken Adderall before knows the rush of confidence you feel while taking it.\nIt gives you energy, sharpens your focus, and makes you believe that every single word you are writing is great stuff. \nUnfortunately, it comes at a terrible cost. Health aside, it makes you feel awful if you try to get work done without it.\nYou feel sluggish…\nYou feel foggy…\nYou feel completely overwhelmed…\n**Again, I knew that I needed to stop taking it on a regular basis. But I still had a monumental task ahead of me in writing this book. It needed to be a success.** **And, it needed to be completed in five months.**\nThis was not the time that I wanted to feel sluggish, foggy, and overwhelmed.\nI needed to write. I needed to research. I needed to get a lot of work done on my computer in a short time.\n**My already negative cycle turned into something darker.** \nI ignored the pain in my hands, the desire for my body to sleep, I took more Adderall, and kept typing…\nOver the next three months, I wrote 140,000 words. My first draft. It was done. Little did I realize that this still wasn't even the worst part of the writing process.\n**The part that really did me in was editing.**\n# The editing process\nOne of my favorite lessons on writing comes from William Zinsser’s masterpiece: [On Writing Well: The Classic Guide to Writing Nonfiction](https://www.amazon.com/Writing-Well-Classic-Guide-Nonfiction/dp/0060891548). In it, Zinsser argues that great writing is not accomplished in the initial writing process, it is all about the editing.\nThis applies to every piece of writing that is currently out in the world. It applies to every article that has ever been written and it applies to the words you are reading now.\nThere's a lot of pressure to find the right words, put them in the right order, and ensure they put into the right flow to resonate with the audience.\n**When publishing a book, that editing pressure increases tenfold. Because** **once you put something in print, you can't change it.**\nThis idea stressed me out constantly. This was my chance. I had a real opportunity to become a published author and use this book to get sales, credibility, and speaking gigs. \nI could not screw it up. Every word had to be perfect. Combined with Adderall, this is a recipe for disaster.\nAlthough Adderall gives you confidence, it also makes you obsess over details. You completely lose sight of the forest and obsess over every bit of bark on the trees.\nWorse, I realized that I was unnecessarily obsessing over the details, which made me even less confident in the end product.\nThis led to even more obsession, even more time at my keyboard, even less sleep, and more need for Adderall.\n**It felt like a cycle I could not get out of.**\nBecause if I tried to take a day without it I would feel sluggish, foggy, and completely overwhelmed.\nSo I kept at it. Come hell or high water I was going to finish this book without caring about my health. I could care about my health in April. My deadline was March, and I was going to spend as many hours at my keyboard editing and writing as I could.\n**By a miracle, the book was published on time. Whether it was actually good is up for anyone who has read the book to judge.**\n**At the same time, the damage to my right hand was now so bad that I had to wear a brace throughout the day.**\nI didn't have health insurance, I didn't have money to see a doctor, so I turned to Dr. Google to try to come up with some way of healing it.\nThis wrist brace was the best I could find. \n**Now, it was so obvious that I needed to finally treat this problem. I finally needed to take a break. But, it was time to promote the book. So once again, I kicked the can down the road.**\nMoreover, publishing did not result in the outcome I had hoped for. The book was generally well-reviewed on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Will-Heroes-Proven-Greatness-Anyone/dp/B01FDPBCQC/ref=sr_1_3?crid=3NGL230TQCUGD&keywords=The+will+of+heroes&qid=1646699568&s=books&sprefix=the+will+of+heroes%2Cstripbooks%2C64&sr=1-3), [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29369590-the-will-of-heroes), and [Audible](https://www.audible.com/pd/The-Will-of-Heroes-Audiobook/B01FDPC7WA).\nHowever, the problem, as is often the case, is that **the audience** **just wasn't big enough**.\nI tried desperately to promote the book as much as I could, but no matter what I tried, it seemed like I was destined to only make about $1000 per month.\nThis, of course, meant more credit card debt was piling up.\n**When I found myself more than $20,000 in debt at this point, it seemed like it was time to finally give up the dream.**\nI had given absolutely everything to this and it still wasn't enough. Yet, at the same time, I heard over and over and over again that my own personal heroes of business, athletics, and life simply never quit. They learned, they adapted, and they kept persisting even when it looked like all hope was lost.\nAs I reflected on everything that I had learned by that point, I wondered if I needed to think bigger. Maybe I need to look at the wider world beyond writing about the science of willpower.\n**If I really wanted to achieve my purpose by helping individuals use the tools of science to unlock the greatness within their minds and take control of their future, why not work directly with the scientists and researchers themselves?**\nDespite the abysmal position my health and finances were in at that point, I decided to double down.\n# To be continued…\n[The Dark Side of Entrepreneurship: Part Two](https://www.econic.co/blog/the-dark-side-of-entrepreneurship-part-two)",

This was the fourth new city that I have moved to in the last 15 years.\nDespite [being an introvert](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/maximize-willpower-introvert-extrovert), I have become used to meeting new people, making new friends, and building a support network.\nBut this was New York City. Perhaps it would be harder to do so here?\nI heard stories of people who moved to the city in the past and felt terribly lonely, despite being surrounded by 8 million people.\n_Perhaps I would be next on that list?_\n**It was this challenge that made me clarify my ideas about how to make new friends and deepen relationships.**\nWhile I was formulating my ideas, things started getting worse on the national stage.\n## Armed and Lonely\nAfter yet another mass shooting by someone who was bullied, lonely, and a need of genuine friendship, Bill Maher posted [this video.](https://youtu.be/WGp-omDD3V0)\nIn his editorial New Rule, Bill addresses America's growing loneliness crisis and its link to mass shootings.\nIn it, he states that **20% of people in my generation, the millennials, do not have a single friend – 25% don't even have an acquaintance in real life.**\nThis is amongst the most dangerous trends out there right now.\nHumans are the ultimate social species.\nFor millions of years of our evolution, we could not survive the wilderness on our own. Our ancestors who survived were the ones who banded together in tribes.\nThis is why we evolved to feel loneliness.\nLoneliness feels bad because Mother Nature wanted you to be motivated to find a tribe that will help you survive.\nToday, we don’t need a tribe in order to fill our basic human needs of nourishment and safety, but the [primitive part of our brains](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/short-term-and-long-term-motivation) doesn’t know that. To our brains, finding a tribe is just as important as food, sleep, and sex.\n**So if we can’t find a tribe, we begin developing problems.**\nIn his book, [_Lost Connections_](https://amzn.to/2mXJ4za), Johann Hari argues that almost all of our problems stem from not having great relationships with others.\nHe points out that not only can you see this problem amongst the mass shooters out there, but also amongst the drug addicts, homeless, anxious, and depressed.\n_With all of the negative consequences that occur when you don't make friends, why don't we have a methodology for making new friendships?_\n_Why do we leave people to just figure it out for themselves?_\n_Why do we spend so much time talking about the problem of loneliness without offering a clear solution?_\nWith the consequences of our lonely society growing, **I set out to find that solution.**\nAs an introvert, making new friends and deepening relationships has never come natural to me. I have never been able to rest on my natural talent to find new friends. I have needed a strategy.\nWhat I learned so far will hopefully guide both introverts and extroverts alike toward more deep and meaningful friendships.\n## SOCIAL MEDIA NOT REQUIRED\nThe first thing to note is that social media is not required – and probably makes things worse. [I left social media two years ago](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/i-left-social-media-1-year-ago-heres-what-happened) and my friendships have not only deepened, but they have grown.\nI am now friends with many more people than I ever was on social media.\nOf course I don't have the literal quantity of “friends” now that Facebook said I did. But when it comes to genuine, deep, human friendships, I have many many more.\nBecause although social media allows you to connect with one another, **it does not allow you to bond.**\nYou may be able to comment, like, and share status updates with one another on social media, **but you cannot deeply confide in anyone.**\nYou cannot share your problems in a honest and meaningful way.\nYou cannot provide advice and support in the way that we have evolved to do.\n**Social media is a performance.** Even if you are vulnerable and ask for help on social media, people will only respond with the advice that sounds good — not the advice that you really need.\nYou need those face-to-face interactions where you go through hard times with people and come out the other side stronger as individuals and with a stronger bond as friends.\nSocial media may increase the number of people that you know, but it cannot deepen the bonds that you have with them.\nEspecially because it provides a platform for your ego to flourish. And letting go of your ego is the first step to building deep and meaningful friendships.\n## Step 1: Let Go of Ego\nEgo focuses your attention inward.\n_It is the thing that makes you feel good about getting the validation of likes._\n_It is the thing that makes you feel miserable when your post goes ignored._\n_It is the thing that makes you feel “special” and superior when you succeed._\n_It is the thing that makes you feel lonely and worthless when you fail._\n**Ego, more than anything else, will be the thing that prevents you from forming deep and genuine friendships.**\nA friend is someone who genuinely wants the best for you. In order for that happen, the other person has to put their ego aside and put your interests ahead of their own.\nThe same applies for you. If you want to develop real friendships, you have to put your own ego aside and focus on being the best friend you can be for the other person.\nThus, the main change in mindset that you must have if you are to make new friends is to focus on them and not yourself.\nDon’t think about making friendships for your own personal gain.\n**Think about the fact that other people are probably just as lonely as you are**. They need a friend just as much as you do.\nIf you can let go of your own ego and focus on simply being the best possible friend you can be for someone else, they will return that friendship to you.\nThis may seem unfair…_If other people want new friends, why aren't they setting aside their own egos to be the best friend they possibly can be for you?_\nIf that thought crossed your mind, you now know what your ego sounds like. **Do not listen to it.**\nIf at any point during the rest of this article that little voice inside your head says “things aren't fair” or that “other people should put in this work and I shouldn't,” that is your cue to stop listening to that voice.\nThat voice is the key thing that is going to get in the way of the true happiness that you can develop through rich human relationships.\n**Everything that I recommend from here on requires that you set aside your ego and put other people first.**\nBecause that is what genuine human relationships are built on. People being there for other people.\n## Step 2: PlaY OFFENSE\nNow that you have let go of your ego, the next step is to understand that you can't just wait around for friends to come to you (playing defense).\nYou have to play offense.\n**The vast majority of people are not going to come to you looking to make plans.** This is not necessarily because they don’t want to hang out with you.\n_Lots of people are busy._\n_Lots of people are also shy and introverted._\n_Lots of people are hoping that someone else makes plans and invites them to come._\nWhen I first moved to New York, I only had three loose connections in the city.\nEven though these people all knew that I was moving to New York in May, **I couldn’t just wait around and expect them to reach out to me — I needed to reach out to them.**\nI wasn’t sure exactly what each of them would be interested in doing, which could have led to analysis paralysis. I could have worried incessantly about whether or not what I proposed would be “cool enough” for them.\nBut that would’ve got me nowhere. Instead, I reached out to each of them just to get a cup of coffee.\nOnly one of them actually accepted my coffee proposal. One of the other two suggested we explore [Prospect Park in Brooklyn](https://www.prospectpark.org). The other one suggested we get brunch.\nPerhaps I could have come off “cooler“ if I had looked up their social media‘s and seen what the other two were interested in. But that wasn’t necessary. All that was necessary was trying to set up a situation to hang out and get to know one another better.\nMost people are genuinely grateful when someone else plays offense and invites them to something fun — especially if you follow the next step.\n## Step 3: Seek to Understand\nOnce you are able to set up a meeting with someone else, **the biggest mistake that people make is worrying incessantly about looking cool.**\nThis is the egotistical angle.\nYour ego isn't just arrogant. It's also fragile.\nIf you are worrying about whether or not you’re “good enough,“ “cool enough,” or too socially awkward to hang out with the person that you’re meeting, your attention is focused on the wrong thing — yourself.\nYou must think about them.\n**Everyone has a desire to be understood.** This goes beyond the narcissistic need for someone to talk about themselves. We all want someone to take the time to truly get to know us.\nIf you can give that gift to another person, they will give it back to you in return.\nAfter setting up my plans with each of my loose connections in New York, I went into each interaction not trying to put on a performance that I thought each person would like.\n**My attention wasn't focused on me. It was focused on them.** I genuinely wanted to get to know them better. I wanted to learn about their experiences in New York. I wanted to learn what advice they had for someone like me who just arrived.\nEach of them had knowledge and experience in my shoes. So each of them was willing and eager to share their advice with me.\n**The most important thing in this step is genuine curiosity.** If you are as introverted as me, you will not find it natural to meet with strangers or even loose connections. You will worry about what they think about you.\nBut, introverts have an advantage when it comes to building genuine friendships – asking questions.\nExtroverts relate to one another by sharing stories. Introverts relate to one another by asking questions.\nIf the person you’re meeting with is an extrovert, then they will be deeply grateful you’re asking good questions and genuinely interested in what they have to say. Rather than just waiting for your turn to speak.\nIf the person you are meeting with is introverted, then it will be a little bit more difficult to get them to open up. But, once again, they will find it refreshing that they are meeting with someone who can ask great questions and is genuinely interested in the answers.\nThis step is where ego can really get in the way.\nThe other person may not be as comfortable seeking to understand you as you are seeking to understand them at first. Give them time.\nIn our self-obsessed culture, people may not be used to someone who is genuinely curious and empathetic. They may not even know how to express these qualities themselves. Don’t hold that against them.\nInstead, as your friendship grows, let them know of your genuine desire to understand who they are as a person.\nIn my own friendships, I have been upfront about my introverted nature and how resting on my natural curiosity is what allows me to build friendships with people like them. They are always fascinated to learn more. I’m sure they will be with you as well.\nEspecially if you succeed in Step 4…\n## Step 4: Show AppreciatIon\nWith a good understanding of your new friend — and a focus on them and not you — you can start to find things that you genuinely appreciate about them.\nLike with being understood, every single person wants to be appreciated for the things that make him or her special.\nIf you can give the gift of genuine appreciation to another person, they will be eternally grateful.\n**Appreciation is different than flattery.** Flattery is generic. It looks at the surface level elements of a person and tells them what you think they want to hear.\nIf you took the time to genuinely understand the person you are meeting with, then you will notice things at a much deeper level that you appreciate about them.\nThey may be talents that you don’t have yourself, they may be characteristics that you respect, or admiration for adversity they have overcome in life.\n**As you are asking questions, open your mind up to the things that you genuinely appreciate about this person**.\nEveryone of the three people that I met with had something that I genuinely appreciated about them. For each person, it was different.\nFor one, it was the fact that she left Nebraska to move to New York to pursue her dream in the fashion industry.\nFor another, it was the fact that he was a far more successful entrepreneur than I was.\nFor the third, it was the fact that, as an extrovert, he had the confidence to make friends with random strangers that I don’t have.\nI genuinely admire each of these traits in the people that I met with. And by communicating that appreciation effectively, it made the other piece person grateful and strengthened the bond between us.\n## Step 5: BE VULNERABLE\nThe last step in creating genuine human friendships is to be vulnerable.\nNow that you have started building a genuine bond with this other person, it is time to open yourself up to be vulnerable.\nThis is not easy – especially for introverts – but this is what will take your relationship from an acquaintance to a genuine friendship.\nIf you've done your job well up to this point, the other person is eager to learn more about you.\nThis is where people can start making mistakes. **Insecurities make us believe that we should only share our positive qualities.**\nThis may get you more likes on social media, but it will not help you build a stronger bond of friendship.\nHowever, being vulnerable is far from easy. I have found **the best way to share my vulnerabilities is to connect them to things I genuinely appreciate about the other person.**\nFor example, my new friend who moved to New York to pursue her dream in fashion, I shared that I would never have had the confidence to move to New York as a 22-year-old as she did. I barely summoned the courage to do so as a 29-year-old!\nFor my entrepreneurial friend, I shared some of the key mistakes that I have made so far in my entrepreneurial career and asked for his advice.\nFor my extroverted friend, I shared how it was hard for me to meet new people so I’m deeply grateful for people like him who make it easy.\nAdmitting each of these things to people I met with was uncomfortable. But to them it was endearing.\nSay instead that I had let my insecurities get the best of me with my entrepreneurial friend. I would have told him all of the successes that I've had as an entrepreneur, hoping that would make him like and respect me more.\nBut that would have undoubtedly led to him talking more about his successes and kept everything service-level.\nInstead, he shared some of the mistakes he's made over the years and what he learned from those experiences.\nThose are the deeper conversations that lead to genuine friendships.\nIt's easy to share your successes with somebody. That's why we find it so easy to share our wins on social media.\nIf your goal is to simply add more friends on Facebook, share your hopes, dreams, and successes.\n**If you want to gain real friends, share your fears, insecurities, and failures.**\nHow other people respond to that will show you who your real friends are.\n## ConcLUSION\nIn 2015, after raising $13,000 on Kickstarter to write [The Will of Heroes](http://amzn.to/1U8xw2M), I moved from Chicago to Florida to seek solitude and write the book.\nI finished the book in six months, I stayed in solitude for three years.\nI thought that I was doing the smart thing. I was still trying to succeed as an entrepreneur and I was devoting myself entirely to my work.\nBut, despite the fact that those three years were the most productive of my life, I didn’t accomplish much of anything..\nEven though I was making a living in a tropical paradise and working on things I was passionate about, I was missing something vital to the human experience—friendships.\nI was lonely.\nThat loneliness motivated me to visit a friend of mine in New York. During my trip, he introduced to his friends and I decided to move to the city.\nGoing from solitude to one of the largest, most intimidating cities in the world, was not easy. That’s why I came up with these steps to help me make new friends and deepen relationships.\nThey have taken me from three loose connections to dozens of great friends in less than six months.\nIf you can set aside your ego and follow the steps above, I am confident you will achieve similar results.\nAnd as your friend group grows, so will the amount of understanding, appreciation, and vulnerability in our world.\nThat is something we could all use more of.  \nP.S.

His book, [Deep Work](https://amzn.to/2ZOYrb9), was very influential in helping me through the editing process of [The Will of Heroes](http://amzn.to/1U8xw2M).\nI wanted to achieve Cal’s level of success – and I thought social media was a necessary part of making that happen.\nYet, not only was social media not necessary for him now as an established author, **but it was never necessary for him at all.**\nThis opened my mind to new questions:\n_Maybe social media isn’t necessary – even for business owners..._\n_Maybe it’s not a part of success..._\n_Maybe it’s actually getting in the way…_\nWith this in mind, I began taking a skeptical look at my social media. And in July of 2017 I learned that **it's not worth it.**\nHere are all the reasons why:\n## IT WASN’T PROFITABLE\nSocial media is a time sink.\nIt siphons valuable time away from actually building products, solutions, and putting in the work necessary to build a company.\nAlthough you do have access to a lot of potential customers for free, it’s not the only medium in which to market.\nAnd the time I spent on social media was less profitable than other ways of getting In touch with my audience like email and SEO.\n## It was against my purpose\nI started Willpowered to help people implement the practices of science to create a better future for themselves.\n**Social media is directly opposed to achieving that goal.**\nSocial media is a place where talking about your goals, dreams, plans, etc. is an end in itself.\n[This will only lead to frustration.](http://www.willpowered.co/maps/talk-is-the-path-to-frustration) It feels great to talk about what you are going to achieve and get encouragement from friends and family via their likes and comments.\nIt feels much better, in fact, than the feelings you get from doing the hard work it takes to actually achieve your goals, dreams, and plans.\nSo, sadly, many of us choose to procrastinate the actions that will get us where we really want to go in favor of even more talk on social media.\n## IT WAS ADDICTIVE\n> “The tycoons of social media have to stop pretending that they’re friendly nerd gods building a better world and admit they’re just tobacco farmers in t-shirts, selling an addictive product to children. Because let’s face it, checking your likes is the new smoking.\" - [Bill Maher](http://www.willpowered.co/maps/talk-is-the-path-to-frustration)\nThis was the most disheartening finding.\nThe stated purpose of the major social media companies is something along the lines of “to connect the world.“ This sounds great on paper, but **the fuel they need to accomplish that purpose is your time.**\nTo capture as much of your time as possible companies use a combination of social validation, positive reinforcement, and news-related outrage to get you coming back again and again.\nAs [Tristan Harris](https://youtu.be/C74amJRp730), a former Google employee who witnessed the design of this “brain hacking” process, described in [an interview on 60 minutes:](https://youtu.be/awAMTQZmvPE)\n_“They want you to use it in particular ways and for long periods of time because that’s how they make their money...Every time I check my phone I’m playing a slot machine to see ‘what did I get?’...this is one way to hijack people's minds and form a habit._\"\n**This was the last straw.** No matter what benefit I saw to myself or my company from social media, this hijacking process wasn't worth it.\nSo I left.\n## What I Lost\nOn a personal level, I lost many things being off social media.\nI was no longer \"in the know\" about current events, life events of friends and distant family members, or the latest #Hashtag news.\nOn a professional level, I wasn’t able to share timely and relevant articles associated with those events.\nThe biggest thing I missed out on was timeliness. All of the important information eventually filtered down, but I always heard the news late and my content was less timely.\nIf you're someone who absolutely has to know things right away, or your company has a timely aspect to it, I don't believe that leaving social media will be beneficial.\nYou simply will not have the same ability to learn and communicate with your audience in as timely a manner.\n## What I Gained\nOne morning, several months into my leaving social media experiment, I looked over the sunrise and a feeling of peace came over me.\nBefore leaving social media, my Instagram strategy was to take a picture of the sunrise every morning.\nThis killed many birds with one stone. It showed the world that I was up early enough to watch the sunrise, it gave me an excuse to come up with something wise and profound to say, and it was always a beautiful image.\n**However, eventually, I stopped appreciating the sunrise for itself.** I only saw it as a way to achieve my own ends.\nAfter quitting Instagram, I could watch the sunrise and just appreciate it.\n**Rather than [feeling anxiety](http://rise.willpowered.co/), I started to feel peace.** I wasn't worried about what others thought about me, I just sat there and enjoyed the moment.\nWhen you're on social media, you see the world through a lens of what it will say about you. You curate the world to tell a story about yourself – whether true or false.\nNot having to tell that story, and just simply being able to appreciate life for what it is, took a huge burden off of my mind.\nI no longer needed to worry about what Instagram images would get me the most likes, what tweets would get me the most retweets, and what part of my story would make me look good to others.\nI could just be grateful for the opportunity to live my life.\n## Conclusion\nThere are undeniable benefits to social media. I have no doubt that more people would know about Willpowered if I was still posting on social media everyday.\nHowever, whatever benefit may come from that, the cost simply is not worth it to me.\nSince leaving social media, I have been able to appreciate the world much more for what it is. Rather than worrying about how I can use it to tell a story about myself that I think will get me likes.\nThis has led to greater calm, clarity, and even greater friendships than I ever had when I was on it.",

Then I checked out the app I use to track my progress— [Zero.](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/zero-fasting-tracker/id1168348542?mt=8)\nSeeing my fasting streak, my fasting average, and all the other metrics surrounding my progress, **I got a renewed sense of faith that I could cross the finish line without eating.**\nThere was no motivational speech that I needed to watch, no guilt I needed to instill in myself for wanting to eat, no other trick that I needed in order to succeed.\n_I just needed to see the data._\nTwo months later, not only have I fully embraced this habit of time restricted eating, I have actually narrowed the time that I eat from 10 AM to 6 PM down to 10 AM to 2 PM.\nAll because I started tracking the data until it became a habit.\n**Self-awareness is the first step to self-improvement.** And the same principle that helped me make a habit of time restricted eating has also helped me:\n-   Improve my mental health\n-   Improve my physical health\n-   Strengthen my relationships\n-   Make the most of my time\nHere are the 10 metrics I use to track success in each of these areas:\n![Content | 10-key-metrics-for-personal-and-professional-success.png](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5416af3ce4b0f910e3133ead/1560354602560-OF5TIIS768X803FTKI2R/Content+%7C+10-key-metrics-for-personal-and-professional-success.png)\n## 1\\. Meditation\n### Category: Mental Health\n### Success Metric: Meditate for 1 hour/day\n### App Used: [Headspace](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/headspace-meditation-sleep/id493145008?mt=8)\n![Meditation data.jpeg](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5416af3ce4b0f910e3133ead/1560253131960-THT0H6UFT8GE1AAPVYC8/Meditation+data.jpeg)\nThe most important value in my life is mental health.\nEverything good, bad, happy, sad, it is all a matter of how your mind interprets your world.\n> Your mind can make a hell of heaven — or a heaven of hell.\nThat's why the most important metric that I track is whether or not I got at least one hour of meditation every day.\nIn total, I'm up to over [1,000 hours of meditation](http://www.willpowered.co/maps/what-i-learned-from-meditation?ref=Metrics) at this point, but I would have never got there if I didn't make sure that every single day for the last several years I've got in at least one hour of meditation.\nI'm not perfect, of course, but thanks to keeping track of this metric, I’m close.\nI know that one hour of meditation probably sounds like a lot – and it is. But I didn't start with one hour a day. I started with 10 minutes a day, then 20 minutes a day, then built up from there.\n**I highly recommend that you adopt a meditation practice in your own life.** To help you start, I recommend the [Headspace meditation app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/headspace-meditation-sleep/id493145008?mt=8) – which helps you track your progress and create a daily practice.\nIf it doesn't seem like you have time to meditate, I recommend waking up 30 minutes earlier than you normally would and meditating during that time (I wake up every day at 5 AM and meditate until 6 AM).\nThe science on whether or not meditation can replace sleep is mixed. But I personally start the day more refreshed after an hour of meditation than if I were to sleep that hour.\nThat is not to say, however, that sleep is not important.\n## 2\\. Sleep\n### Category: Mental Health\n### Success Metric: 14-day Sleep Score\n### App Used: [Under Armour Record](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/record-by-under-armour/id895425891?mt=8)\n![IMG_0234.jpeg](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5416af3ce4b0f910e3133ead/1560253667011-9W2OP1G9EUE8PFUKK2O0/IMG_0234.jpeg)\nBetween April and October 2017 was probably the hardest six months of my life.\nI was barely scraping by with Willpowered and really fighting to get a new product called Educo Community off the ground.\nBefore that time, I thought that the right thing to do as an entrepreneur is to cut back on as much sleep as possible and dedicate yourself 100% to work work work.\nHowever, that philosophy led to frustration, poor decision-making, and missed deadlines.\nSo in April 2017, I started **going to bed and waking up at the same time every single day no matter what.** It was then that I realized how much more clear-minded, focused, and disciplined I was when I had a good night's sleep.\n> If I hadn't changed my sleep habits, I doubt Willpowered would still be around today.\nIn order to get the most accurate effective metric, I shoot to get an \"80\" sleep score on the [Under Armor Record app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/record-by-under-armour/id895425891?mt=8). This takes into account the last two weeks of your sleep, how consistent you were, how many hours you got, etc.\nA perfect score is 85, so shooting for 80 ensures that I'm getting quality sleep on a consistent basis – leaving me refreshed, alert, and ready to face any challenges that are ahead in the day.\nSince adopting the practice of trying to be as consistent as possible, I have found that I am never sleepy throughout the day. Tired yes, exhausted yes, but never sleepy. **And that is crucial when trying to perform at your best.**\n## 3\\. Journaling\n### Category: Mental Health\n### Success Metric: Journal Entries/Week\n### App Used: [Drafts](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts-capture-act/id1236254471?mt=8)\n![Journaling Metrics.jpeg](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5416af3ce4b0f910e3133ead/1556055500312-WKNRAMOYYSLNL6QY9DWU/Journaling+Metrics.jpeg)\nThe final mental health metric that I track is journaling on a daily basis.\nI try to shoot for six journal entries per week – as usually there is one day where it is difficult to get the time to have a full journal entry.\n[I have written about the benefits of journaling before.](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/willpower-increases-creativity?rq=Creativity)It allows you to gain a new perspective on the things that happened during the day, which allows you to see things in a new way, thus improving your creativity.\nAs my practice of journaling has matured, however, **I have grown to find even more benefits from it.**\nUsing the [Drafts app](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drafts-capture-act/id1236254471?mt=8), I can dictate all of my journal entries (which is why you can see some spelling errors in the image above.)\n> The process of speaking all the things that happened throughout the day out loud helps me to make sense of what they mean.\nThis is extremely therapeutic. It helps me more than writing everything down on a computer because then you can't hear how your problems sound out loud.\nHaving said that, if it is not an option for you to dictate your journal, it is still a beneficial process to get all of the ideas that you had throughout the day on paper and out of your head.\n**When ideas are in your head, you repeat them over and over and over again.**\nWhen you get those ideas down on paper, however, you can gain a new perspective on those ideas and dig deeper to find the lessons hidden in your problems.\nThe act of trying to make sense of all of your thoughts, feelings, and emotions helps you by allowing you to find meaning in the adversity, work, challenges, and problems you face.\nIt is this ability to make sense of my problems that led me to believe that journaling is almost as vital to my mental health as meditation or sleep.\n## 4\\. Workouts\n### Category: Physical Health\n### Success Metric: Workout plans completed/week\n### App Used: [Strong](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/strong-workout-tracker-gym-log/id464254577?mt=8)\n![Workout metrics.jpeg](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5416af3ce4b0f910e3133ead/1556056442832-7YE6GM2CNI75PEDV0SJF/Workout+metrics.jpeg)\nMoving on to the thing I value most in life after mental health – physical health.\n**Being both mentally and physically healthy is what allows you to be your best self for your family, friends, and coworkers.**\nIt doesn’t matter how important you are, how much money you have, or how much free time you have if you are sick. So it is vitally important to track your physical health.\nTrying to track the success of my workouts on a consistent basis has been one of the most difficult things for me. What should the metric of success?\n_Number of miles run?_\n_Weight lost?_\n_Amount of weight lifted in the gym?_\nEspecially as I have grown older and [stopped competing in the Spartan Race](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/spartan-race-lessons?rq=Spartan%20race), I have learned that your results aren’t a valuable metric to track your success.\n> When coming up with a metric for tracking your progress, you want to choose something that you have complete control over.\n> \n> The best metric that I have found that allows for this is completing your workout plan for the day – whatever that may be.\nMy goal right now is to put on muscle. So I am currently lifting weights five days per week and resting two days. I plan out all of my workouts ahead of time, usually building on the progress I made the week before.\nThen I just need to follow the plan – even if that plan is simply to rest for the day.\nSuccess with your workouts is simple, but difficult. **You likely will not fail because you chose the wrong plan, you will likely fail because you didn’t follow it.**\nIf you can track your success rate in following whatever plan works best for your goals, you will be much more likely to reach those goals.\nTo plan and track my workouts, I use an app called \"Strong\" for iOS. I highly recommend checking it out – especially if you have an Apple Watch. It is constantly improving and worth every penny.\n## 5\\. Fasting\n### Category: Physical Health\n### Success Metric: Successful Fasts/Week\n### App Used: [Zero](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/zero-fasting-tracker/id1168348542?mt=8)\n![Fasting metrics.jpeg](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5416af3ce4b0f910e3133ead/1560254531442-R17MB9HCFEIM3ZFN29HJ/Fasting+metrics.jpeg)\nAs mentioned in my introduction, I am currently following a time restricted eating habit.\nTo see the full list of benefits of time restricted feeding, I highly recommend you check out [these resources.](https://www.google.com/search?q=benefits+of+time+restricted+eating)\n> But, to sum it up, the main benefits of time restricted eating result from taking it easy on your digestive system.\nWith time restricted eating, your digestive system only needs to work for a few hours per day. So it can use the rest of the time to clear out old, dead cells and replace them with healthy new ones.\n[According to Dr. Rhonda Patrick](https://youtu.be/XW7g_KD52PA), in order to get all of the benefits of this diet, you only need to do it five days a week. Which gives you some flexibility to eat whenever you would like on the weekends or at important social gatherings.\nIf you are to try this yourself, know that it is going to be extremely difficult at first. But eventually, your body will get used to it **– and you will begin to love it.**\n## 6\\. Promises\n### Category: Relationships\n### Success Metric: Promises kept\n### App Used: [Trello](https://trello.com/colinwillpoweredco/recommend)\nMoving on from physical health, **the next most important value to me are my relationships with others.**\nThis could be family, this could be friends, this could be coworkers, it could be anybody in your life who is important to you.\n> One of the best ways to show another person how much you care about them is to make and follow through on your promises.\nSo, whenever I make a promise to someone, I write down that promise, write down what I need to do to accomplish that promise, and what date I must follow through.\nThen I track how many promises I have outstanding and how many I have completed.\nBy tracking how many promises I have outstanding, I never leave another person hanging simply because I forgot what I promised to do for them.\nSince beginning this practice, I have become much more reliable, much more dependable, and much more trustworthy to my friends, my family, and my coworkers.\nTo track all of my promises, I use \"[Trello\"](https://trello.com/colinwillpoweredco/recommend) – a project management app.\nWhatever you currently do to track your tasks should work perfectly well for this. The most important thing is to just keep track of what you promised, when the promise is due, and what you need to do to follow through for that other person.\n## 7\\. Leadership\n### Category: Relationships\n### Success Metric: Average Leadership Score\n### App Used: [Leadership Checklist](http://www.willpowered.co/leadership-checklist)\nI believe everybody who wants to become a leader **needs a leadership philosophy that they stick to no matter what.**\n> My leadership philosophy follows the acronym, “PREACH.“\nThis is getting a little bit more detailed, but at the end of every day, I ask myself six questions to ensure that I was the kind of leader that I wanted to be that day.\nPreparation – Were you prepared for all meetings, calls, and crises?\nReliability – Were you reliable to all team members, clients, and customers?\nExpertise – Did you ask the right questions and provide the right answers when needed?\nAccountability – Were you accountable for all tasks and promises you made to others?\nCalm – Were you calm and levelheaded in the face of adversity today?\nHonesty – Did you tell the truth or, at least, not lie?\nFor my leadership metrics, I want to say “yes” to those answers at least 90% of the time. Thus, I have continually updated percentage of times I said “yes.”\nTo track this, I use my SMaC tracker template which you can [download here](http://www.willpowered.co/s/SMaC-Formula-Template.csv) and learn more about [here.](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/create-a-smac-formula?rq=smac)\n## 8\\. Eat my Frog\n### Category: Time\n### Success Metric: Days of eating my frog\n### App Used: [Trello](https://trello.com/colinwillpoweredco/recommend)\nMoving onto the fourth most important value to me – time.\n**Time is a far more valuable resource than money.**\nTime is a resource that doesn't go up and down. Once it is gone, it's gone forever. No matter how rich Bill Gates gets, he will never be able to buy back the last year of his life.\nWe don't get second chances – **so we better spend our time wisely.**\nThe most important practice I do on a daily basis in order to maximize my time is [to \"eat my frog\" first thing every day.](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/eat-the-frog-first?rq=Frog)\nBy this, I obviously don't mean that I actually eat a frog. I'm referring instead to this quote by Mark Twain.\n> “Eat a live frog first thing in the morning and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day.” – Mark Twain\nTwain was advocating that if you do the hardest thing on your to do list first thing in the morning, the rest of the day doesn't seem so bad.\nNot only does doing the hardest thing first thing in the morning put your mind at ease, because at least you accomplish the hardest thing on your list, but it also **sets the tone for the rest of the day.**\nIt sends the message going to confront your challenges head-on today.\nOn the days that I don't eat my frog first, not only is it a greater agony because I didn't get the hardest thing on my to-do list done right away, it is also harder to take on the other tasks.\nBecause I didn't start the day by embracing challenge. **I started by running away from it.**\nTo accomplish my frog first thing in the morning every single day, I break down my hardest task the night before into [three or four manageable chunks.](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/chunking)\nThat way, when I start my day at 7 AM, all I need to do is take each of those manageable steps one at a time in order to get the job done.\n## 9\\. Deep Work\n### Category: Time\n### Success Metric: Hours of deep work/Week\n### App Used: [Leadership Checklist](http://www.willpowered.co/leadership-checklist)\nMany of us are more worried about \"looking busy\" than getting the job done.\nI am very lucky to be able to do my work remotely, so it's more important that I get results than look busy getting those results.\n[Deep work](https://amzn.to/2WF0PEt) is a concept articulated by [Cal Newport](http://www.calnewport.com/) – a professor at Georgetown University and one of the top minds on how to turn down the volume on our noisy world so we can work on the things that matter.\n> Deep work is when you completely shut down all potential distractions to accomplish work that is more difficult and more meaningful to you.\nI cannot write this article and watch a movie in the background. I cannot edit this article and answer texts at the same time. And every time my mind gets distracted, it takes a significant amount of time to get back to the same level of focus and productivity.\nThings like writing, developing products, and other complex **tasks that are not easily replicable are the type of work that really stands out in the world.**\nThe more time you can spend doing deep work, the better you will be at complex tasks, and the better you will be able to compete in the marketplace of the future.\nI try to spend at least 20 hours a week on deep work – whether that is personal or professional work.\nTo keep track of this, I just take note of the time that I shut down all notifications on my phone and computer and tally up my time at the end of the week.\nI highly recommend you check out Cal Newport‘s book, [_Deep Work_](https://amzn.to/2WF0PEt) , and put this practice to work in your own life.\n## 10\\. Plans\n### Category: Time\n### Success Metric: Plans Outstanding\n### App Used: [Trello](https://trello.com/colinwillpoweredco/recommend)\n_\"A goal without a plan is just a wish.\" - Antoine de Saint Exupery_\nWhen we think about willpower, we typically think about playing defense. We think about seeing the temptation in front of us and summoning the willpower to resist it.\n**We do not plan on how we are going to resist temptation ahead of time.** We do not think to identify the situations where we will be tempted to veer away from our goals and set ourselves up to resist that temptation.\nRather than using our willpower to work on a project a little bit each day, we procrastinate until the last minute and depend on it for a rush of productivity at the end.\nTo get the most out of our limited willpower, this is the opposite of what we should be doing.\n> That is why for every metric listed above, I have a plan for achieving it.\nBy tracking the plans that I have for each of these metrics, I am able to ensure that I am always playing offense.\nBy playing offense, I can assess which plans work, which plans don’t, and how to change the strategy to improve each metric.\nPlanning is the glue that holds all of these metrics together. It ensures that the time that I spend working on each of the above is spent wisely.\n## Conclusion\nSelf awareness is the first step toward self improvement.\nNo matter what your goal, you will have a much better chance of achieving it if you start by coming up with a success metric, assessing where you are currently with that metric, and setting a goal to improve it.\nI didn't want to share my “scorecard“ with you because I think these are the most important metrics for everybody.\nI wanted to share it because tracking these metrics helps me move toward success in the things that matter most to me – my mental health, my physical health, my relationships, and my time.\nWhat you value most in life will likely be different than what I value most.\n> But whatever you value most in life, I am sure that those things will improve if you find a metric, find a behavior, and find a way to improve.\nI wish you all the best with your own personal and professional “scorecard.“",

      "content": "It was the beginning of 2018 and I believed that I was on the cusp of \"the next big thing.\"\nAfter nine months of hard work, I had built a platform called [Educo](http://educocommunity.com/) with TED Talk speakers to help them turn their content into step-by-step applications that people could use to take action on the advice from their talks.\nThe idea of helping individuals take action on expert advice had been a dream of mine for years – and finally it was about to become a reality.\nIt was not long, however, **before my dream turned into a nightmare.**\n_We didn't hit our sales projections for the quarter._\n_Our applications were full of bugs and the customer complaints continued to pile up._\n_There was no question that I had created more problems than I had solved._\nI had failed.\nI let my investors down, I let the TED speakers down, I let our customers down, I let myself down.\nBut the company wasn’t out of cash yet. **And this was no time to feel sorry for myself.**\n## Responding to Failure\nRather than wallow in guilt, I needed to take a cold hard look at my situation.\n_How much runway did I have left?_\n_How could I use that time to keep the company from folding?_\n_What services could I provide to keep the company alive in the long-term?_\nI only had a month of cash left, **so I needed to act fast.**\nLuckily, I lived in Florida at the time and could rent my apartment out on Airbnb at a hefty profit.\nAlthough this would buy me some time, it also forced me to confront one of my greatest weaknesses as an entrepreneur – a lack of attention to detail.\nMy building frowned upon renting out your place on Airbnb. So I needed to get every detail of the check in process right in order to pull it off without them finding out.\nThis increased pressure helped me hone my organizational skills. It exposed me to new automation tools and processes. It helped me realize that I'm actually quite good at operations when I set my mind to it.\n**The Airbnb was a success. I bought myself some time.**\nNext, I needed to start selling my services.\nAlthough we didn't have success with the end-users of our applications, I found that I was very good at selling to the TED Talk speakers.\n**I learned that selling isn’t about trying to convince people to buy your product.** It's really about asking good questions, understanding the person’s needs, and working together to find a solution.\nI created such a strong bond with the TED Talk speakers that I felt completely comfortable telling them the hard truth of the situation and asking if they knew of any opportunities for someone with my skill set.\nOne of the speakers, [Bill Eckstrom](https://youtu.be/LBvHI1awWaI), connected me with [Josh at Econic.](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshberrygphr/)\nJosh told me he needed someone to head up a new project his company was working on [to help rural communities develop entrepreneurial ecosystems.](https://the-combine.teachable.com)\nI quickly found **I was just as passionate about working with entrepreneurs as I was about working with TED speakers.** I have been working here in my dream job ever since.\nI made it through the hardest time of my life – and became a better person because of it.\n**That doesn’t change the fact that I still let a lot of people down.** However, if I had beat myself up with guilt, I would’ve only made things worse.\nRather than embrace guilt, here are 3 better ways to respond to failure:\n## 1\\. What Would You Tell Your Best Friend?\nImagine your best friend took a risk like I did and failed.\n_What advice would you give them?_\n_Would you try to make them feel guilty about their poor decision-making skills?_\n_Would you call them stupid and hopeless for taking a chance?_\n**Of course not!** You know intuitively that making them feel bad won't help. Right now, they need your support to rebound from this failure and learn from it.\n_Are you any different? What would your best friend tell you if you failed?_\nWhen you treat yourself like a best friend, you gain perspective on the reality of your situation.\nYou can see that you can’t dig yourself out of a hole by simply beating yourself up. You can see that this isn’t the time to mope. **This is the time for action.**\nThe next time you start to feel guilty about a failure, pause.\n**Think about what you would tell your best friend if they were in your situation.** The advice you give him or her may be the difference between getting out of a hole – or digging deeper.\n## 2\\. Withhold Judgment\nWe live in volatile and uncertain times.\nYou have no idea how a failure may end up actually helping you over the long-term.\nI had no idea that facing a failure would reveal my operational skills. I had no idea that failing would lead to finding the best job of my life. **I had no idea that, despite the failure, 2018 would still turn into the best year of my life**.\nWhen you allow yourself to embrace guilt over a failure, you judge the situation for how it appears today.\nHowever, you have no idea how failure is going to look in hindsight.\nInstead of being quick to judge, be quick to seek the whole truth of your situation.\n## 3\\. Seek the Whole Truth\nFeeling guilty makes you feel emotional. And when you have failed, an emotional, judgmental, response is not what you want.\nInstead, you want to take a calm, cool, levelheaded approach to understand the truth of what really happened here.\n_Why did things not work out the way you wanted?_\n_Was it the wrong goal?_\n_Was it the wrong behavior?_\nFinding the answers to these questions helps you learn from failure. **However, the more guilty you feel, the harder it is to find those answers.**\nFeeling guilty about a failure feels bad enough. Searching for all the reasons why you failed feels even worse.\nSo when you feel guilty, you don’t want to find a truth that will make you feel even worse than you already do.\nInstead, you want to push away all of your feelings of guilt and find the things that make you feel better.\n_Bring on the Ben & Jerry’s._\nIt may feel noble to feel guilty when you fail. **But a far more noble act is to search for the truth.**\nThe next time you fail, use that as an opportunity to learn from the truth of your mistake.\n## Conclusion\nFailure is inevitable. **Beating yourself up about that failure, isn’t.**\nOur brains are always worried about how others may judge our success and failures. That judgment was once the difference between the safety and security of the tribe, and facing the wild alone.\nThus, we all have an internal judge who makes us feel guilty whenever we don't live up to the story we want others to believe about us.\nDefeating this internal judge is no easy task. I doubt anyone ever silences it completely. But understand that you are not imprisoned by your guilt. You have a choice.\n_You can choose to think about what you would tell your best friend._\n_You can choose to withhold your judgment and see how this failure looks in hindsight._\n_You can choose to look past your guilt in search of the truth._\n**Rather than beat yourself up, you can choose to get up.**",

      "excerpt": "The date on my calendar was approaching and **my fear was growing…**\nWeeks earlier I had told my mentor and friend, [Bill Eckstrom](http://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/author/ref=dbs_a_mng_awm_scns_share...",
      "content": "The date on my calendar was approaching and **my fear was growing…**\nWeeks earlier I had told my mentor and friend, [Bill Eckstrom](http://www.amazon.com/kindle-dbs/author/ref=dbs_a_mng_awm_scns_share%3F_encoding=UTF8&asin=B07H8S9WH9), about [the project](http://rise.willpowered.co) I was working on to help professionals flip anxiety from a negative emotion into a positive ally in helping them perform at their best.\nAs soon as I told him about it, he told me about a summit that his company was hosting for 70 sales managers from around the country. He said that they would love a tool like this and invited me to come to network with them.\n_The irony of feeling anxious about going to a networking event with a bunch of sales people to sell them a tool that helps you deal with anxiety was not lost on me._\n**I was going to be thrown into a pack of wolves** – people who knew all of the tricks of the trade of sales – and I was going to have to sell them.\nAs the date of the conference approached, however, I saw this as the perfect opportunity to prove the value of my tool and the value of the three essential pieces necessary for growth as an entrepeneur.\n## 1\\. Make Space for Growth\nWhen I told the founder of Econic, [Josh Berry](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshberrygphr), about the opportunity to get our [Rise to the Challenge](http://rise.willpowered.co) program off the ground, he provided the space to capitalize on it.\nHe not only equipped me with the resources I needed to get to the conference and network, he also created a culture where I knew that it was OK for me to go there and fail (as long as I was doing my best and learning from the experience).\nIn order to innovate, you need to make this type of space available.\nIt would have been easy for me to sit in my office and create a product based on what I _believed_ sales managers would want.\nIt would've been a heck of a lot cheaper as well...**in the short run.** In the long run, all of that time I spent at home working on the product could have been completely wasted.\nHad I stayed home, even though it would have been cheaper, it would've been me pretending like I had all the answers.\nBy having the space to get out of the building and talk to the real customers, that allowed me to **focus on coming up with the right questions.**\n## 2\\. Be Curious\n_\"What would you consider your personal brand?“_ asked John Rood, head of marketing of the Disney Channel.\nJohn and I had been in a conversation for a good 30 minutes as we discussed his work, his philosophy, and his journey from the cornfields of Nebraska to the executive offices of Hollywood.\n_“So many millennials want to be ‘The voice of their generation.'_ I told him. _\"Well, I want to be **‘The ears of my generation.'** I want to be curious, open-minded, and listen to every word of a conversation like this.\"_\nJohn was the keynote speaker that evening, and due to our conversation, he asked me personally to give him feedback. Because he knew that I would be thoughtful and listen to everything he had to say.\n**Curiosity builds trust.** John had trust in me to give him valuable feedback because I was genuinely curious about him, his story, and how I might be able to learn from him to improve my own work and life.\nCoincidentally, John brought this up in his speech when he talked about the steps to making a sale:\n1.  Build trust.\n2.  Understand the person's needs.\n3.  Propose a solution to address those needs.\n4.  Close the deal.\nWhether you want to sell insurance, or your new innovative product, **many of us want to jump right to step three.** But this makes your customers skeptical and makes you untrustworthy. Because then you are selling. You're not helping them solve a problem.\nCuriosity is the driving force behind building trust and understanding.\nIt’s no good if you create the space to learn from your customers if you don’t close your mouth, open your ears, and take the time to understand your customers through genuine curiosity.\n## 3\\. Take Action\nAnother aspect of John's speech that really hit home for me was the necessity of balance in whatever product you are creating.\nFor him and Disney, that was **special entertainment with heart.**\n![Content | Hedgehog.png](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5416af3ce4b0f910e3133ead/1556658411623-PQDGOZXSNPX20MDLDG0D/Content+%7C+Hedgehog.png)\nHe said that whenever one of those three factors is not in balance, that's when they start losing their way.\n_If they make it special with heart, but forget to make it entertaining, they fail._\n_If they make it special and entertaining, but forget to give it heart, they fail._\n_If they make it full of heart and entertaining, but it's not special, they fail._\nThey need to keep their films balanced in all three of these ways in order to succeed. And when you look at the box office returns of Disney versus any other studio in recent years, it's hard to argue with this formula.\nIn my work, the three pieces that keep us in balance are making space, being curious, and taking action.\n![Content | Disney formula.png](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5416af3ce4b0f910e3133ead/1556658384184-JN12ZFJZS6Z1BD3Z1JB6/Content+%7C+Disney+formula.png)\nIt didn't matter if I made the space and listened, if I didn’t take action to talk to the right people and ask good questions.\nAnd it doesn’t matter how many lessons I took away from the conference if I don’t take action on those lessons that I learned.\nAt the end of the day, those entrepreneurs who end up making a real difference in the world **are those who take action.**\n## Conclusion\nInnovation doesn't happen in a laboratory – it happens out in the world where your customers exist.\n**You must make the space for you and your team to get out there**, meet with customers, and begin experimenting on all the assumptions you have about your great idea.\nThen, when you meet with them, **you must be genuinely curious.** The default is to start first by presenting your solution before you build trust and understand the needs of your customers.\nBut those who are truly innovative ask questions that build trust with their customers and take the time to genuinely understand what they need to solve their problems.\nThen **you must begin taking action.** You must take action to get out of the building and engage with your customers. You must take action to ask the right questions. And you must take action to take the next steps based on what you learned from your conversations.\nIf you can get all three pieces of this puzzle working together, then you can make a truly great impact on the lives of the people you are serving.\n_[Originally posted on Econic.co](https://econic.co/the-3-crucial-pieces-of-effective-innovation/)_",

If you want to get rich, you start a religion.” – L Ron Hubbard. \\[[1](https://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/33503.L_Ron_Hubbard)\\]_\nIn 1953, science-fiction writer L Ron Hubbard set out on a mission – create a new religion based on his book _[Dianetics](https://www.amazon.com/Dianetics-Modern-Science-Mental-English/dp/140314446X)_.\nHubbard truly believed in the psychological benefits of the practices suggested in the book. So he released it to the psychological community – expecting to be hailed as a genius for discovering these new ways of understanding and improving the human mind.\n\"The scientific community couldn't make heads or tails of it,\" said Lawrence Wright in his groundbreaking book, _[Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood, and the Prison of Belief](https://amzn.to/2FVz9Ow)_. \"The psychological community had no idea how he came up with the ideas. It didn't have any empirical evidence or testing.\"\nBut L. Ron believed in his practices. And he was determined to show the scientific the community wrong. \\[[2](https://amzn.to/2FVz9Ow)\\]\nSo, not only did he start running workshops to help people implement the practices in Dianetics, he used those practices as the foundation of his new 'Church of Scientology.'\nOver the second half of the 20th century, the Church of Scientology would register millions of members and amass over $2 billion in assets from membership counseling and “donations.\" \\[[3](https://web.archive.org/web/20080709230659/http://www.villagevoice.com/2008-06-24/news/Scientologys-Crushing-Defeat/full)\\]\n## Scientology Today\nToday, despite having billions of dollars in assets, Scientology memberships are declining – because most people now know what Scientology _really_ is. \\[[4](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-06-29/scientology-numbers-going-backwards/4101958)\\]\n-   We know that L. Ron Hubbard wasn’t a prophet, he was a science-fiction writer.\n-   We know that _Dianetics_ wasn’t based on real science.\n-   We know that L. Ron Hubbard started the Church of Scientology just to make money. \\[[2](https://amzn.to/2FVz9Ow)\\]\nIn other words, **we know the truth about Scientology.**\nThat's why, despite the fact that they invest millions of dollars in advertising, the number of Scientologists continues to fall.\nThat wasn't always the case. Before the invention of Google, people were seduced by Scientology's message of self-improvement. They couldn't read the stories of former members who were [beaten, imprisoned,](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2101953/Top-Scientologist-tells-beaten-tortured-locked-45-days-ant-infested-desert-compound-trailer.html) and [scammed out of their life savings.](https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2016/12/21/leah-remini-scientology-and-the-aftermath-episode-4-/95689966/)\nThey were sold a lie – _and had to suffer the consequences of that._\nIn today's world, people can search Google, immediately [see the tragic stories of past members](https://www.google.com/search?q=scientology+stories), and make a wise decision based on the evidence to avoid Scientology.\nWith this access to new information and ability to see the facts, _why do we regard the second half of the 20th century as a 'Golden Age' for the truth, and today as a 'Post-Truth Dystopia'?_\n## Enlightenment\nFrom the late 17th century until today, we have been living in the enlightenment. Much of the world was once unknown, but thanks to the scientific revolution, we have shone a light on nearly every corner of it – learning all the truths that once hid in the dark.\nThis enlightenment accelerated rapidly with the invention of the Internet.\n30 years ago, most people had no idea what the culture of another continent was like. They had no idea of the true suffering done by dictatorships in other countries, nor did they have easy (often free) access to the art, literature, or culture of people living on the other side of the world.\nNow we have the unprecedented ability to connect with people, understand more about our objective world, and the subjective experience of the people living within it.\nThe truth, in other words, has never been more accessible.\n_So how do we find it?_\n## Scientific Method\nThe best way to navigate through the noise of our world, is through implementing the principles of the enlightenment – specifically the scientific method.\nThis may sound boring or overwhelming, but it really isn't.\nTo find the truth, just follow this simple process:\n## 1\\. What Question Are You Trying to Answer?\nThe first step in designing an experiment is to state the question you are trying to answer.\nUsing our example above, the question would be “should I join Scientology?\"\nYour inner scientist has significant questions about the world – embrace them. Don’t take the easy path [by pretending you have the answers](https://educocommunity.com/blog/1247506/stop-visualizing-and-start-taking-action). Instead, write down “What precisely do I want to know?“  \n## 2\\. What Is Your Hypothesis?\nTo answer this question, you must come up with a clear and testable hypothesis.\nLet’s say that I was seduced by Scientology’s message of self-improvement. So my hypothesis is:\n**I should join Scientology to improve my personal and spiritual life.**\nIn designing your experiments, be clear and specific about your hypotheses. Make sure that you can test them.\n## 3\\. That Hypothesis Will Fail If...\nHere's where many of us make mistakes when it comes to designing experiments.\nYou shouldn't design an experiment to prove yourself right – rather, you should design an experiment to try to prove yourself wrong.\nSo my hypothesis that Scientology will improve my life will be proven wrong if I learn there is a greater chance that my life will be made worse by Scientology.\nIf your hypothesis survives the attempt at failure, you have more reason to believe in it.\n## 4\\. What Specific Steps Do You Need to Take to Test That Hypothesis?\nNow that you have a clear benchmark for failure, it's time to create the experiment.\nTesting your hypothesis does not necessarily require that you create a whole new experiment. In our example, I would just need to read the stories of 10 real people who have been through Scientology. If the majority of those stories were of people whose lives were ruined by Scientology, then my hypothesis would be proven wrong.\nAs you can see from [this simple Google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=scientology+stories), that is clearly the case.\nWhen designing your experiment, isolate the variables as much as you can. And do the little things to get the details right.\nThe truth is more prevalent and easier to find than ever before. You merely need to implement the tools of science to find it. Using this simple experimentation formula has helped me find the truth within the noise.\n## Conclusion\nThe truth always wins. Because it is real.\nThe world will continue to get brighter – **and the truth is the only thing that survives the light.**\nLies that were once peddled by people like L. Ron Hubbard cannot survive that light.\nLies have a shelf life. **The truth endures for generations.** Science has propelled humanity forward to accomplish incredible things in a short period because one scientist built on the work of the scientists who came before her.\nNo one will build on the work of L. Ron Hubbard. There is nothing to build on. It is simply a house of cards. And that's why, despite having over $2 billion of assets, Scientology continues to lose members. \\[[4](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-06-29/scientology-numbers-going-backwards/4101958)\\]\n**There was no golden age of the truth.** People have been lying since the dawn of communication roughly 70,000 years ago.\nOur problem with the truth today is simply different than it was in the latter half of the 20th century when Scientology could sell you a compelling story without you being able to “Google it.”\nSo don't believe anyone who tells you that we're living in the 'Post-Truth Era' when there's more truth illuminated today than any other time in human history.\n[\\*Sources](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/jjZjzfOReGzwyChhkzbQ)",

      "content": "_It can feel like you’re drowning._\nNo matter what you do, no matter how hard you work, no matter what productivity strategies you try; **you just can't seem to find enough hours in the day.**\nI knew that feeling well. But I was able to escape the quicksand over the last year through one simple rule:\n**Work one fewer hour each day.**\nNo, this isn't going to be one of those posts about how you need to rest more – I didn't escape 'the quicksand of not enough hours in the day' by taking that hour off.\n_I did it by devoting that one hour to **automation.**_\nAt the end of every day, I reviewed my tasks for that day and spent one hour automating as many as I could.\nThis helped me tap into the '1% Better Rule.'\n## The 1% Better Rule\n![](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/s9pihfE5SHO1JKhcK8Pn)\nIf you devoted yourself every day to become 1% better than the day before, _how much better would you be after one year of work?_\nMany people think that you would perhaps be three or four times better by the end of the year, but due to the compounding interest, **you would be 37 times better.**\nI learned this rule through [this article by James Clear](https://jamesclear.com/marginal-gains). But I always found it somewhat deceiving because \"better\" is ambiguous.\nThat ambiguity, however, **does not apply to automation.**\nDevoting myself to one hour per day every day over the last year to automation has continued to help me accomplish more in less time at a compounding rate.\nAnd this is the first of a series of posts I am putting together to teach you how to do the same.\n## 1\\. What should you automate?\nThe opportunities for automation are limitless. There is no limit to what you can accomplish by automating your tasks, your emails, your sales pipeline, your marketing funnel – anything you do on a daily basis can be done more effectively.\n**This opportunity, however, comes at a price.** With everything you can automate, _where do you start?_\nThe limitless opportunity available with automation can lead you to feel overwhelmed and end up automating the wrong things, **or nothing at all.**\nTo overcome that tendency, the best thing you can do is ask yourself, _\"what am I trying to accomplish here?\"_\nRather than looking at the opportunities for automation, start by looking at what you're already doing, and then ask yourself, _\"how can I do this automatically?\"_\nSo the first steps are to write down every recurring task you can think of:\n1.  Get everything that you worked on in the past day.\n2.  Get everything that you worked on in the past week.\n3.  Get everything that you worked on in the past month.\n**Write it all down.**\n## 2\\. Create a Dashboard\nNow that you have a list of every process within your business or life that you do on a regular basis, **now we need to put it on a dashboard.**\nA dashboard will allow you to see what's going right, what's going wrong, and how automation is making an impact.\nHere is an example of my dashboard:\nIt shows all of the essential processes of my work and life: including sales, marketing, product – even my workout and meditation time.\nBy having this dashboard, I can create various automated solutions that tie into each of these processes and help me get more done in less time.\nWith all of your tasks:\n1.  Put them into a category such as sales, marketing, etc.\n2.  Write down as much time as it usually takes you to get each of those tasks done.\n3.  Store them in your favorite spreadsheet or database tool (I personally use Airtable which you can sign up for here.)\n**This dashboard will provide a solid foundation for you to build on.**\n## 3\\. Sign up for Zapier\nZapier is a tool that allows you to connect apps you use every day to automate tasks and save time. You can connect any of their 750+ integrated apps together to make your own automations. What's more it's quick and easy to set up - you don't need to be a developer, anyone can make a Zap!  \nAs far as automation tools, they are hands-down the best. Here’s a [quick video on Zapier](https://youtu.be/Ng2AKc_2kP0) [](https://youtu.be/Ng2AKc_2kP0) if you would like to learn more.\nYou can use it to:\n1.  Auto-organize your emails.\n2.  Create new to-do items based on communication with team members.\n3.  Track your progress in sales, marketing or any other domain in your business or life.\nHere are a few ways I use Zapier to automate my life:\n### **Managing Emails**\nBeing prompt in your email communication is important, but you don't want to be checking your email every hour.\nThis Automated solution sends me a text notification when a \"VIP\" emails me.\nNow I can be prompt when it matters, without checking constantly.\n* * *\n### **Sharing Content**\nIf you're a content creator, you probably spend a lot of time sharing your content via social media, content platforms, and emails.\nThis Automated solution recognizes when I publish a new post and immediately shares it with my followers:\nThis frees me to spend more time _creating content_ and less time sharing it.\n* * *\n### **Managing Customers**\nIf you're in sales, marketing, or own your own business, you know how important it is to track your customers.\nThis Automated solution recognizes when a new student signs up for a Guide and begins tracking their progress toward a successful completion.\nThis shows me which steps work, which need improvement, and how to help customers complete each Program.\nWe live in a world of technology. Zapier allows you to connect your various services to automate your life.\n1.  To get started with Zapier, you can set up your own Zapier [account at this link.](https://zapier.com/app/dashboard)\n2.  Or you can get free access included if you join ourGet Things Automated Program.\n## Conclusion\nTime is not money – **it is much more valuable.**\nEven with $100 billion, I would not be able to buy back the last year of my life. However, I can do more with the next year of my life, and every year after that, because I committed myself to automation and allowed the marginal gains to build.\nThe best time to start automating your life was 20 years ago. **The second best time is today.**",

[How others respond to you is one of them](https://educocommunity.com/blog/1247017/how-to-handle-critical-feedback).\nOf course, you can improve your communication skills, but if someone has a bad day, they are not going to respond as well to a proposal.\nIn moments like that, you need to let go of focusing on results, and focus on what you can control.\n## Internal Locus of Control\nThis focus is known as the internal locus of control.\nIt lets go of the results – good or bad – and measures your success by your practice, your preparation, your effort, and any other factor within your control.\nIn making sales calls, I did everything I could to [focus on the actions I took](https://educocommunity.com/blog/1247113/focus-on-the-process-not-the-result), rather than the results I got.\nThis is easier said than done, however. Just knowing that you should focus on what you can control doesn't stop bad results from being painful.\nThat's why it's not enough to know these things, you must practice being mindful of them.\n## Practicing Mindfulness\nIn her TEDx Talk, _[The Power of Mindfulness: What You Practice Goes Stronger](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeblJdB2-Vo)_, Dr. Shauna Shapiro opened my mind to the power of practicing mindfulness.\nPracticing your _internal_ locus of control makes your mental preparation and effort muscles stronger.\nLikewise, practicing an _external_ locus of control makes your shame (poor results) and arrogance (good results) muscles stronger.\nWhen I saw this talk, I knew that not only did I need to follow her advice and begin practicing mindfulness more in my own life, **I needed to add her to my list of calls.**\nAfter speaking with her, I formed my life philosophy and started practicing what I believe would be the most valuable thing to grow stronger – bringing my best self to every moment.\n## Bring My Best Self To Every Moment\n**It is always now.**\nThe past cannot be changed; the future cannot be known. And all you can control is what you do right here, right now, in this moment.\nDr. Shapiro helped me realize that in order to achieve my grand visions of [creating a world where the truth is heard](https://educocommunity.com/p/why-we-exist), [helping people put science into action](https://educocommunity.com/blog/891745/purpose), or [achieving any of my audacious goals](https://educocommunity.com/blog/1287350/before-you-start-your-goal-shape-your-path), I would have to practice bringing my best self to each moment along the way.\n_Starting first and foremost with my initial call with her._\nApplying that logic to the phone call, I would bring my best self to the preparation beforehand – creating a list of insightful questions.\n_Then I would bring my best self_ to listening and learning from her answers – rather than just waiting for my turn to speak.\n_Then I would bring my best self_ to every moment afterward – developing a prototype to show what we could accomplish together.\nIt worked out. And my phone call with Dr. Shapiro set the standard for every call afterward.\nAnd the prototype turned into one of our most popular programs – the Daily Mindfulness Journal.\n## Conclusion\nThis is the only chance you'll ever get at today. Make sure you learn from it.\nIn life, there will always be things outside of your control. Failure, rejection, illness, loss.\nAlmost everything is ultimately out of your control. But there is one thing that is within your control – **who you choose to be in this moment.**\n_Will you be your best self?_\n_Or will you give into self-pity, arrogance, or deceit?_\nThis is not an easy decision – which is why good intentions aren’t enough.\nIt requires time, it requires action, and it requires **practicing mindfulness.**",

      "content": "_If it ain't broke, don't fix it._\nThat's what former Marine, Erik Therwanger, [told me](https://educocommunity.com/blog/1478177/erik-therwanger-goal-planning-strategy) about the approach to leadership that he learned in the Marines.\nIt's also the foundation of his 90 day run.\nThe concept is incredibly simple – the US military has a long history of teaching young men and women how to become the best version of themselves in just 90 days.\n_So why not apply that same methodology to the civilian world as well?_\n## What will you accomplish in the next 90 days?\nUnlike many goals we set, the GPS makes the process concrete by asking, “What will you accomplish in the next 90 days?“\nFor me, I wanted to be consistent with my sleeping patterns – going to bed at nine, and waking up at five.\nThis would ensure that each day my mind was right, I had a good night sleep, and I was able to perform well on a consistent basis in the very inconsistent reality of entrepreneurship.\nWhen setting your own goals, ensure that you are concrete about what exactly you want to achieve and [why it is important to you](https://educocommunity.com/blog/1246975/start-each-goal-with-why).\nBy specifying what to do over the next 90 days, there was no wiggle room. I knew the mission – and it was time to make it happen.\n## What habits will you add to achieve this goal?\nWhen it comes to achieving a new goal, [consistency conquers and intensity squanders](https://educocommunity.com/blog/1247370/consistency-conquers-intensity-squanders).\nYou can’t do everything in the first ten days. The excitement _will_ wear off.\nThat’s why it’s more important to build habits rather than achieve quick results.\nFor me, the habit I needed to add was something that was worth waking up for.\nLiving near the Atlantic ocean, I had the chance to wake up and watch the sunrise every morning.\nA 90-day goal is accomplished one day at a time. What habits do you need to add to your schedule to make those days count?\n## What habits will you eliminate to achieve this goal?\nNext, because you can't do everything, you need to eliminate habits as well.\nFor me, I needed to eliminate continually checking my email.\nBeyond the fact that a stressful email received at 8 PM is going to make it difficult to fall asleep at 9 PM, there's also a degree of anxiety that one feels in continually checking your email – which makes it difficult to go to sleep.\nSo, I set up this automation to get the essential emails sent to my phone so I did not have to check my inbox after 5 PM for anything important.\nTo achieve a goal in 90 days, you can't just create more time out of nothing. So don’t focus only on adding new habits – focus on eliminating the wrong ones.\n## Who in your personal network can you reach out to?\nYour network is your best tool for accomplishing any goal – use it.\nMy roommate and I both decided that we are going to wake up every day at 5 AM, so when the alarm went off, we were there to hold each other accountable to waking up and starting our days off right.\nThere's no shame in asking someone else for advice or help in becoming your best self and making improvements in your life.\nIn many cases, like mine, you will find someone who wants to make a similar change in their own life and together you can achieve that goal.\nBefore you start your next goal, find someone to be an advisor, a partner, or someone who will simply hold you accountable for what you want to achieve in life.\n## How will you remind yourself to achieve this goal?\nBeyond others, technology can also serve as a powerful tool in helping you become your best self.\nPersonally, I noticed that it was a lot easier to let go of the need to check my email at night when I set a reminder to be done with them at five.\nSimilarly, I received a text message along with my alarms every morning from my [GPS app](https://educocommunity.com/p/goal-planning-strategy) that reminded me why it was worth getting up, watching the sunrise, and being consistent with my sleep routine.\nIn reaching your own goals, never underestimate the power of a reminder. Sometimes the difference between sticking to a 90-day goal and giving it up is just that extra push to make the right decision.\n## Conclusion\n90 days later, here are my results.\nAs you can see, I was pretty consistent in my sleep routine. I wasn't perfect, but no one ever is.  \nThe important thing was not that I went to bed every night strictly at 9 PM and woke up every morning strictly at 5 AM. The important thing is that my body now has a routine, it's easier to sleep now more so than ever before in my life, and the next 90 days are likely to be much more productive and healthy.\nNobody reaches perfection in 90 days. But, if you make a deliberate effort, [you can make a lot of progress in that amount of time](https://educocommunity.com/p/goal-planning-strategy/?product_id=557145&coupon_code=MONTH&utm_medium=Referral&utm_source=Educo&utm_campaign=Subscribed+goal-planning-strategy).",

It is curious, creative, and creates tools to help our community thrive.\nThere is also a politician.\nThis part of us succeeds by _looking_ good. It is composed, cooperative, and tells the community what they want to hear.\nThe scientist wants to ask questions, the politician wants to pretend it has all the answers.\nTo see which one is more useful to both us as individuals and as a society, just look at where science and politics are today.\nThe former is getting us to Mars; the latter is making Mars look appealing.\nTo train my inner scientist, achieve better results, and defeat my inner politician, I designed simple experiments by answering 6 simple questions from \"Get Things Automated.\"\n## 1\\. What Question Are You Trying to Answer?\nThe first step in designing an experiment is to state the question you are trying to answer.\nA question on my mind recently has been, “What is the best way to spend my time?”\nThere are many processes in place to run Educo: marketing, sales, product development, operations, etc.\nWith so much on my plate, it's difficult to know how to allocate my time to produce the best results for customers, for experts, and for members of my team.\nYour inner scientist has significant questions about the world – embrace them. Don’t take the easy path [by pretending you have the answers](https://educocommunity.com/blog/1247506/stop-visualizing-and-start-taking-action). Instead, write down “What precisely do I want to know?“  \n## 2\\. What Is Your Hypothesis?\nTo answer this question, you must come up with a clear and testable hypothesis.\nI wanted to learn the most valuable use of my time, so I needed an educated, testable prediction of what that activity might be.\n**My hypothesis was that automation was the best use of my time.**\nEvery hour invested in automation leads to more free time in the future. So it seemed logical that time spent automating our marketing process would be more valuable than time spent producing new marketing content.\nIn designing your experiments, be clear and specific about your hypotheses. Make sure that you can test them.\n## 3\\. That Hypothesis Will Fail If...\nHere's where many of us make mistakes when it comes to designing experiments.\nYou shouldn't design an experiment to prove yourself right – rather, you should design an experiment to try to prove yourself wrong.\nTo see if automation was a more valuable use of my time, I needed to set a clear benchmark for failure.\nThe key performance indicator for our marketing content is Click-thru Rates.\nSo, I needed to test to see if 1 hour invested in marketing would yield a better Click-thru Rate than 1 hour spent on automation.\nWhen designing your experiment, be sure that there is a clear way for you to fail. And try to make it happen as objectively as possible.\nIf your hypothesis survives the attempt at failure, you have more reason to believe in it.\n## 4\\. What Specific Steps Do You Need to Take to Test That Hypothesis?\nNow that you have a clear benchmark for failure, it's time to create the experiment.\nTo test whether marketing would lead to a better Click-thru Rate than automation, I split my time between the two of those both within the marketing realm.\nFor example, I spent half my time creating content like this which can't be automated.\nI spent the other half of my time focusing on automated marketing activities like recommending already published content based on subscriber interests.\nBy isolating those variables, I could get a better understanding of which activity was more valuable.\nWhen designing your experiment, isolate the variables as much as you can. And do the little things to get the details right.\n## 5\\. When Will You Assess the Results?\nTo get a clear understanding, you need to have enough data [to make a meaningful interpretation](https://educocommunity.com/blog/1247012/how-i-learned-to-confront-the-brutal-facts).\nTo do this, you could check the statistical significance through a service like [A/B calculator.](https://abtestguide.com/calc/?ref=Educo)\nBut always remember that you don't need to be perfect in answering your questions through experiments.\nI set my deadline for a month to test these two things against each other because that would give me enough time to get meaningful results.\nWhen testing the length of your experiment, remember that you don't need to be perfect. As long as you can be 90-100% sure, it may be worth it to shorten the length of your experiment to move onto the next one.\n## Conclusion\nHere are the results of my experiment…\nAs I suspected, automation yielded much higher results than manual actions. This resulted in a higher-than-average Click-thru Rate.\nThat is not to say that doing things like creating new content is not necessary. You have to keep things fresh. However, it should take a lower priority than automation.\nI have created [a lot of content over the years](https://educocommunity.com/blog?ref=navbar). And it is a better use of my time to get the content already published to people who could use it to improve their lives than it is to keep sending them a new post that may or may not be relevant to them.\nHowever, this was just one experiment. I still need to test automation against sales, product development, and many other areas to feel that it is indeed the top priority in the business.\nBut at least I'm one step closer. And that's what science is all about.",

      "content": "If there is one thing I’m sure of, it’s that right now you have a problem on your mind.\n**You’re not alone.** We all have problems.\nAnd like most people, I often think I'm alone in dealing with them.  \n_I think that nobody has to deal with the same problems I do..._\n_Nobody understands what I have to go through..._\n_And because of that I feel overwhelmed._\nIt's a flaw we all have.\nDespite the problems beneath the surface, we are very good at keeping our outward appearance composed.\nBecause we can't experience the inner thoughts of others, we have no idea what kind of problems they are struggling with right now – and how similar they likely are to ours.\nTo overcome this tendency and gain some perspective, I ask myself these 7 questions posed by ‘[Know Yourself: Change Your Behavior](https://educocommunity.com/p/know-yourself-change-your-behavior/?product_id=600588&coupon_code=TRIAL&preview=logged_out).’\n## 1\\. WHAT IS THE SITUATION?\nThe first step in conquering a problem is just to get all of your thoughts, feelings, ideas – everything that has been rattling around in your mind – written down.\nThe biggest problem I'm dealing with right now is learning how to lead others.\nI have been counting on myself throughout my entire entrepreneurial journey, and I need to learn how to let go.\nI need to learn how to give the experts on our platform the freedom to share their ideas on their terms, I need to learn how to lead our team members, and I need to learn what things I need to do and what I can teach to others instead.\nWhen faced with a difficult problem in your life, just ask yourself what is the situation, and get it all out there.\n## 2\\. WHAT CAN YOU LEARN FROM SOMEONE WHO HAS CONQUERED THESE PROBLEMS BEFORE?\nOnce you have the situation specified, reflect on times you've struggled with a situation like this before. Sometimes we are so focused on the problem in the present, that we forget about a solution from our past.\nOr if this is a new problem, we forget that there are other people who have probably already solved it.\nFor me, this was a new problem. So I had to turn to other people outside myself to find the right answers.\nThis question reminded me that the founder of JotForm, an application that I am a huge supporter of. [Aytekin Tank](https://stories.jotform.com/@aytekin.tank) founded his company in 2006 and bootstrapped his way to 2 million users.\nAlong the way, he must have dealt with one or two of the growing pains I’m facing right now.\nWhatever your problem, somebody somewhere – perhaps even your past self – has dealt with it before.\nInstead of feeling overwhelmed by the problem, look to the solutions that have from people who have dealt with similar situations.\n## 3\\. HOW CAN YOU REPLICATE THAT SOLUTION WITH SOME OF YOUR CURRENT STRUGGLES?\nAfter discovering the solution proposed by yourself or others, now it's time to [create a plan to replicate that solution](https://educocommunity.com/blog/1129857/focus-on-the-solution) to conquer your current problems.\nWith me, I knew that to follow the guidance of the founder of JotForm, I would need to read an article by him on a consistent basis.\nThat would help me learn more about his journey, the problems he faced, and what I can learn from them.\nIn many cases, you don't need to come up with some new scheme to solve your problems. You just need to find the solutions elsewhere and use them.\nOnce we have the solution in place, now it's time to change our behavior.\n## 4\\. WHAT BARRIERS DO YOU TYPICALLY FACE WHEN TRYING TO CHANGE YOUR BEHAVIOR?\n[You are creature of habit.](https://educocommunity.com/blog/1247356/key-factors-of-behavior-change)\nJust like you can create habits to perform good behaviors on a regular basis, you also have underlying barriers that typically stop you from changing those habits.\nFor me, the typical obstacle that gets in the way of reading a quality article is other emails.\nI knew that to read a new article by him every day; I needed to put that on my task list, rather than rely on his email newsletter.\nSo instead of signing up for his newsletter, I created [this automation on Zapier.](https://zapier.com/app/dashboard/folder/118932)\nSmall changes like this can make a significant impact.\nRecognizing how you behave will help you create a plan to overcome the typical obstacles you face in changing behavior and reaching your goals.\n## 5\\. WHO HAS ALREADY ACHIEVED THE BEHAVIOR CHANGE YOU SEEK?\nWith a concrete plan in place to overcome the typical barriers you face when changing your behavior, the next step is to look to others within your network.\n![](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/Ld2c47EeRO6pKliyzQ0H)\nThe founder of JotForm is a great example of someone who has probably dealt with many of the same problems I'm struggling with, but there are plenty of others within my network with similar experience building non-tech businesses.\nIncluding an expert on this very platform – [Bill Eckstrom](https://educocommunity.com/blog/1344409/bill-eckstrom-the-growth-rings).\nHe also bootstrapped his company, [EcSell Institute](https://www.ecsellinstitute.com), and would be a great mentor in helping me solve these problems.\nDon't discount the value of your personal network. If you're willing to be vulnerable, you will gain a lot of help, advice, and support from the people who want to see you succeed.\nSince coming up with this plan, Bill has become a great mentor and friend.\n## 6\\. WHO ELSE DO YOU KNOW WITH HELPFUL KNOWLEDGE OR SKILLS?\nBeyond someone who can serve as a mentor, it is also useful to find someone who can serve as a coach. Someone who has more knowledge or skills in the domain than you do and can give you guidance.\n![](https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/f0ZDyjhKRhkV1FcrpJmu)\nFor me, this allowed me to expand beyond the realm of business and to look at leaders of any kind.  \nThat's how I came to know Erik Therwanger, an ex-marine who now gives talks on leadership around the world.\n[He taught me great leadership lessons](https://educocommunity.com/blog/1478177/erik-therwanger-goal-planning-strategy) like the value of maintaining your composure, focusing on the little goals within a crisis, and many more.\nFind someone who has useful knowledge or skills that can help serve as a coach on your way to success.\n## 7\\. HOW WILL YOU GET IN TOUCH WITH THEM?\nFinally, you have to be willing to be vulnerable and ask for their help.\nIt's not easy to admit that you need the help of someone else, but it is always worth it to try.\nTo help myself ask the questions that would make me more vulnerable, I reflected on what my reaction would be if someone else asked for my help.\nThey will likely be honored and happy to help you do what it takes to make the behavior change you seek.  \nWhoever you identify, make sure you set a hard deadline for reaching out to them and asking for their guidance.\n## CONCLUSION\nMost of us feel alone in our problems. But it doesn't take much to realize just how many resources we have at our disposal.\nSimply by asking myself these questions, I was able to find three people I admired who were able to help me become a better leader in one way or another.\nBut simply identifying them was not enough. I needed to be willing to be vulnerable with them, ask them for help, listen to their answers, and truly follow their advice.\nThe next time you face a difficult problem, take some time to reflect, ask yourself these questions, and do what it takes to [change your behavior and solve your problems](https://educocommunity.com/p/know-yourself-change-your-behavior/?product_id=600588&coupon_code=TRIAL&preview=logged_out).",

A.K.A the worst filmmaker of all time._\nAll my life I've been a big picture thinker.\nI've tried to achieve a grand vision... Create a disruptive innovation... And, of course, change the world.\nThis perspective has helped me immensely in handling setbacks, pushing through struggles, and remembering to see the forest instead of the trees.\nHowever, the devil is in the details. And I've had a lot of devils come up and bite me because of my focus on the big picture.\nBut, at the beginning of 2018, I set a 'SMARTS' goal to focus on both the forest _and_ the trees.\nHere are the 6 Key Questions from the [Set SMARTS Goals program](https://educocommunity.com/p/set-smarts-goals/?product_id=519272&coupon_code=TRIAL&preview=logged_out) that guided my journey:\n## **1\\. WHAT SPECIFIC BEHAVIORS DO I NEED TO DO?**\nThe first step in setting a SMARTS Goal is to be concrete about the specific behaviors you want to change.\nIronically, just setting a goal to \"focus on the details,\" isn't very detail oriented. **It leaves way too much wiggle room.**\nInstead, the Set SMARTS Goals program forced me to identify the specific behaviors I needed to adopt, such as tracking my time, managing my tasks, and measuring our company’s progress.\n![Screenshot | SSG Behavior.png](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5416af3ce4b0f910e3133ead/1521716180513-NYZZ90IGM7N46XUOBMUA/Screenshot+%7C+SSG+Behavior.png)\nWhen setting your own goals, always ask yourself, \"What specific behavior do I need to follow to achieve my goal?\"\n## **2\\. HOW WILL I REMIND MYSELF OF MY PURPOSE?**\nNext is to understand your motivation for accomplishing your goal.\nIn the moment, it is easy to allow boredom, frustration, or procrastination to get the better of you.\nBut it’s in those moments when you need to know **why you are doing this.**\nBy using Set SMARTS Goals, [I could articulate why](https://educocommunity.com/blog/1246975/start-each-goal-with-why) it was essential to get the details right. Specifying that purpose helped me focus on the details when it mattered most.\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5416af3ce4b0f910e3133ead/1521716218095-S2H5HD661XSQRBRPT3CA/image-asset.png)\nBefore setting out to achieve your next goal, ask yourself, _why is this worth my best effort?_\n## **3\\. WHAT HAS WORKED IN THE PAST?**\nThe next step in Set SMARTS Goals is to assess whether or not your goal is achievable.\nBut rather than looking at your upcoming schedule to see if you have time for something like this, review your past results.\nBy looking back on what I'd achieved in the past, I saw a lot of stupid mistakes where I glossed over the details. But I also identified the area where I got the details right consistently – automation.\nIn any instance where I took the time to automate a process, I also got the details right in that area. Thus, I now had a clear path to achieve my goal.\n![Screenshot | SSG Achievable.png](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5416af3ce4b0f910e3133ead/1521716147461-YKH2HN6M4ZYE3G0SL3SI/Screenshot+%7C+SSG+Achievable.png)\nBefore setting out to achieve new goals, look at what you've accomplished in the past. When did you set a similar goal in the past? Were you successful? Why or why not?\nThe answers to these questions can be painful. We don’t like reminders of our failures.\nHowever, it is these failures that teach us the most. And reviewing them is not nearly as painful as setting yourself up for yet another failure.\n## **4\\. WHAT LONG-TERM VISION RELATES TO THIS GOAL?**\nNext on the list is to see the bigger picture beyond the goal.\nFor me, I knew I would never accomplish my purpose of bridging the gap between scientific knowledge and public understanding if I wasn't willing to get the details right.\nWith that bigger picture in my mind, I had more motivation to execute brilliantly on the small piece of the puzzle.\n![Screenshot | SSG Purpose.png](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5416af3ce4b0f910e3133ead/1521716075414-BCI29UKU468YXNLS0AOM/Screenshot+%7C+SSG+Purpose.png)\nWith any goal you may have, take the time to remember the relevance of this small part of your broader vision.\n## **5\\. HOW WILL YOU HANDLE SETBACKS?**\n[Setbacks are inevitable](https://educocommunity.com/blog/1247392/how-to-handle-failure).\nThe great thing about tracking your progress is that you see that setbacks for what they are – a flat tire. Not the end of your journey.\nSince starting this goal at the beginning of the year, I have missed several details along the way. But I can see that overall I'm getting much more detail oriented.\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5416af3ce4b0f910e3133ead/1521716039806-8XPP450MAPIAFJ00PRNK/image-asset.png)\n[There is no more significant motivator than progress](https://educocommunity.com/blog/1247486/the-underrated-power-of-small-wins). Remember that when setting a goal, and prepare ahead of time to handle any setbacks along the way.\n## **6\\. WHO WILL I SHARE MY GOAL WITH?**\nHumans are social creatures.\nWe supply encouragement to each other... We provide resources to each other... We provide accountability to each other.\nSet SMARTS Goals allowed me to reach out and share with my best friend my decision to become more detail oriented.\n![Screenshot | SSG Shareable.png](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5416af3ce4b0f910e3133ead/1521715980381-QFRBRZTC5MUH6BJN6KJM/Screenshot+%7C+SSG+Shareable.png)\nJust knowing that he will be there checking in on me has helped me find motivation when I need it the most.\nIt can feel awkward and vulnerable to share your goals with others. But remember that just like you want what’s best for them, they want what’s best for you. So don’t be afraid to share your goals or take their help.\n## **CONCLUSION**\nThe simple decision to set a SMARTS Goal at the beginning of this year set in motion this dashboard:\nIt shows where I am spending my time versus where I should be spending my time.\nA great example of how this helps is shown by the first 6 steps (our sales pipeline) because now I know what I need to prioritize to help Educo flourish.\nI used to gloss over the details like this in our pipeline, but now I can’t ignore the brutal facts.\nEven this dashboard is not perfect when it comes to details. But it is a significant improvement.\nYou will never achieve a goal perfectly.

      "content": "You know the feeling.  \nThat feeling in your gut that makes you want to avoid pushing yourself.\nStaying within your comfort zone feels good. **Life outside of it is scary.**\nIt's complicated, it's challenging, and it can result in hard, cold, embarrassing failure.\n**But it can also result in growth.**\nThus, life asks you a tough question – _comfort today? Or growth tomorrow?_\nIn the moment, the appeal of comfort paralyzes us, and we default to inaction.\nTo overcome this tendency in my own life, I started using [The Growth Rings](https://educocommunity.com/p/the-growth-rings/?product_id=417181&coupon_code=TRIAL&utm_medium=Referral&utm_source=Educo&utm_campaign=Clicked+the-growth-rings) program we developed with [Bill Eckstrom](https://educocommunity.com/blog/1344409/bill-eckstrom-the-growth-rings).\n## **SETTING GOALS OUTSIDE OF MY COMFORT ZONE**\nThe Growth Rings program helps you identify a goal outside of your comfort zone, specify why it's important to reach it, and create a plan to conquer your fears.  \nThe latest goal I set with the program was to create an affiliate partnership with TED.\nOur mission at Educo, after all, is to help people take action on expert advice.\n_So where better to start than by allowing people to take action on an inspirational TED Talk?_\nThis partnership would be a win-win-win.\n1.  A win for customers who get to take action on the Expert’s advice\n2.  A win for the speakers who get to create new value from their talk\n3.  A win for TED who gets affiliate revenue by improving the customer experience – rather than littering it with ads.\nIn concept, all these things seemed to make sense.\nBut, there is always that internal critic telling you that you don't know what you're talking about.\n_\"TED would never partner with a small company like us...\"_\n_\"Don’t embarrass yourself. They’ll never get back to you.\"_\nOr the internal procrastinator...\n_\"Don’t blow your chance. It’s not ready yet. Wait a few months until you’ve grown.\"_\nThanks to \"The Growth Rings\" program, I was able to silence this voice and take action.\n## **6 QUESTIONS TO HELP YOU PUSH YOUR COMFORT ZONE**\nTo help you conquer your own growth goals, I want to share with you some of the key questions posed by The Growth Rings that helped me take on this challenge.\n* * *\n### 1\\. Why is this worth your best effort?\nThe first step in planning to achieve any goal – especially those outside your comfort zone – is to clearly state why doing so is worth it to you.\nThis question helped me remember why it was worth silencing my internal critic and venturing outside my comfort zone.\n* * *\n### 2\\. When will you know you’ve reached success?\nThe next step is to clearly define the ideal outcome is that you want to achieve. It’s very easy to get lost on the way to goal when you don’t have a clear target.\nWith TED, I knew I wouldn’t be done until we had a deal in writing.\n* * *\n### 3\\. Why is this uncomfortable?\nAnother key question to ask yourself outside of your comfort zone is what exactly it is that is causing you discomfort. Fears only exist in the unknown. And by specifying what makes you uncomfortable, you can start to see the thing for what it is.\nFor me, I was mostly afraid of messing up our opportunity.\n### 4\\. What is the worst that could happen?\nTo make the uncomfortable thing even more concrete, I specified the worst case scenario. It’s easy to imagine things going terribly, _but how bad could it really get?_\nThis helped me see that the worst thing that happened is that I made a bad impression or annoyed them. Not ideal, but also not the end of the world.\n* * *\n### 5\\. What actions can you take to prevent that from happening?  \nWith the worst-case clear in my mind, I could start planning actions that would prevent the worst case from happening.\nThis included simple steps like researching who I should reach out to, learning how their partnerships work, and crafting a clear message to them. Once I set that plan, my mind was immediately less afraid of reaching out.\n* * *\n### 6\\. What is the cost of not taking action?\nThis is perhaps the most important question posed by The Growth Rings program. Most of us don’t consider the huge costs that come with inaction.\nBy remembering the fact that partnerships don’t happen overnight, they grow over time, I knew that every day I put off building that relationship was costing me. I knew it was time to act _now._\n* * *\n## **RESULTS**  \nWhat happened? None of my fears were realized.\nI reached out to them, got a meeting later that week, and I am currently waiting for TED to get back to me with the terms of their agreement.\nIt may not work out, or it may not end up being the ideal partnership I envisioned, **but I never expected success.**\nI expected to learn, grow, and prove to myself that life outside my comfort zone isn’t as scary as the internal critic makes it seem.\nAnd from my results, I learned a crucial lesson – **not asking is worse than not knowing.**\nHad I assumed that they would never want to work with us in the first place, had I not opened myself up to failure, had I stayed in my comfort zone, I would not have had the chance to create a mutually beneficial partnership that helps people put ideas into action.\nOn to the next goal.",

Specifying what we're trying to accomplish (The Destination)\n2.  Learning how to achieve it (Getting Directions)\n3.  Clearing the path ahead of time (Roads, Rules, etc.)\nIn other words...\nWe choose to drive a brand new car on terrible roads with vague directions, and \"trust our gut\" to handle any setbacks along the way.\nThen, of course, we blame ourselves when we don't reach the destination.\nAfter all, if you have a great car and neglect the whole concept of a map, what other explanation is there for why you didn't reach your destination?\n_Insert self-criticism and/or self-justification here_\nClearly, this is not a formula for reaching your destination.\n_So is it any wonder that so many of us struggle to reach our goals?_\n## **SHAPING THE PATH**\nThink of the profound implication of this.\nA terrible driver in a \"clunker\" with paved roads, stop signs, and GPS will _always_ beat the great driver with treacherous roads and vague directions.\nThat's the power of the path.\nYet, when you think of what it will take to \"turn things around\" in your life, what do you focus on?\n-   Yourself?\n-   Your coworkers?\n-   The endless list of problems and the lack of time available to solve them all?\nThese undoubtedly merit your consideration, but you're not going to change anybody — including yourself — overnight.\nYou can, however, change your path.\n## **HOW TO SHAPE YOUR PATH**\nThe first principle of shaping the path is recognizing that you're not aiming for perfection.\n_The path to your goal will likely never be as clear as the path you take to work._\nHowever, there is a lot of room for improvement between that level of clarity and what you probably used when you began the journey to your latest goal.\nTo illustrate this, I'm going to show you how I've built Wilson to make sense of the unknown and overwhelming journey of Entrepreneurship.\n> Not through perfection, but through progress.\n### **GETTING THINGS DONE**\nThere's probably no more widely useful and effective Checklist than the [Getting Things Done (GTD)](http://gettingthingsdone.com/?utm_source=Willpowered&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=Shape_the_Path) method by [David Allen.](http://gettingthingsdone.com/meet-david?utm_source=Willpowered&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=Shape_the_Path)\n[\n![Gtd Workflow.gif](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5416af3ce4b0f910e3133ead/1492169612565-0KQE5CPQ9I11EC1JOVBU/Gtd+Workflow.gif)\n](http://gettingthingsdone.com?utm_source=Willpowered&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=Shape_the_Path)\nGTD involves emptying all the \"stuff\" in your head (to-dos, ideas, reminders, etc.) putting them into an in-basket, and identifying what action you need to make progress on every single idea next.\nNearly every person who uses this method sees extraordinary results – getting organized, making progress, and enjoying stress-free productivity.\n**Then, like me, they stop following the checklist...**\nThe GTD Checklist is incredibly boring. You have to process EVERY TASK using the flowchart in the picture.\nTrying to identify the next action to take on all of your to-do items is tedious — and so easy to put off.\nBut if you can summon the discipline to do it...The feeling of calm and clarity you get after you're done processing your in-basket is priceless.\nHowever, most people who feel this sense of calm, slowly but surely let stuff pile up, lose control, then...\nAre back to being constantly nagged by wandering thoughts of something we don't want to forget about — but can't do anything about right now.\nThis was my story far too often — but I was determined to take the boredom out of the process.\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5416af3ce4b0f910e3133ead/1492169798705-SRIIOSXGSXZ0207UFHO8/image-asset.gif)\n### ← So I turned this\n### Into this →\nNow all it takes for me to follow the path from a huge in-basket of stuff to complete organization and mental clarity is just the tap of a button.\nI even set it up so I can process my inbox completely hands-free!\nSo I can walk outside, enjoy the weather, and process all my tasks at the same time.\nAnd so can you.\nIf you join the Consistency Challenge this Spring, you will receive access to all the apps I've built like this to make it easier to get to your desired destination.\nIf you can't join us this Spring, these tips will help point you in the right direction:\n### **1\\. SPECIFY THE DESTINATION**\nThis seems absurdly obvious.\n_But how often when you set a goal do you take the time to specify exactly what \"success\" will look like?_\nWhat are you trying to achieve by going to the gym?\n-   Look better?\n-   Feel more confident?\n-   Set a good example for you kids?\nYour answer likely seems so implicit and obvious, that it seems tedious to respond those questions.\nBut when you face the inevitable temptation to take a day off, making this answer clear and meaningful to you could be **the difference between a failure...[and a habit](http://academy.willpowered.co/p/consistency-challenge?utm_source=Willpowered&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=Shape_the_Path)**\nHere's how Wilson helps me:\n[→ Get this workflow on iOS](https://workflow.is/workflows/d9a748bf53bb46a3933bf8581ea51242)\n### **2\\. GET DIRECTIONS**\nPay attention to this step...\n**This is the most important step that almost no one deliberately takes.**\nHow do you \"get directions?\"\nFind someone who has already reached achieved your goal and learn how they did it.\nNo matter what your situation is, there is someone who has been in a similar situation, with a similar goal and overcame similar obstacles.\nWill Smith explains this best:\nIn the context of your goal, this person is an \"expert.\"\nLearning their story probably won't be able to give you \"turn-by-turn directions,\" but it will clear up a considerable portion of your map.\nLearn the stories of several of these \"experts\" and getting from where you are, to where you want to be, won\"t seem nearly as daunting.\nHere's what I built to always Get Directions\n[→ Get this workflow on iOS](https://workflow.is/workflows/97170fb135cf4ae185bc5f52ecf12f7d?utm_source=Willpowered&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=Shape_the_Path)\n### **3\\. CREATE \"RULES OF THE ROAD.\"**\nAs you can see from this post's title, this is a \"Rule of the Road\" for me.\nI created this list for the same reason we use speed limits, stop signs, and insurance.\nStructure.\nThere are so many unknowns that you're going to come across on your journey — but not all unknowns are created equally.\nYou may be driving to a completely new destination, but you know there will be stop signs, stop lights, and can count on other drivers adhering to them.\nThis structure frees your mind to focus on more important things.\n**\"Rules of the Road\" are your principles, values, and rules** that you can turn to when you need to make a tough decision in an unknown situation.\nWith each goal, there will be at least one value or principle of yours that will be challenged in some way.\nBefore you embark on your journey into the unknown, you need to know where your \"line\" is.\n-   How much time will you devote to this [goal over other priorities](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/think-and-not-or?utm_source=Newsletter&utm_medium=Willpowered&utm_campaign=Shape_the_Path)?\n-   How will you respond when you [face setbacks?](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/never-give-in-to-guilt?utm_source=Newsletter&utm_medium=Referrall&utm_campaign=Shape_the_Path)\n-   How will you deal with the [temptation to quit?](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/principles-before-practicality?utm_source=Newsletter&utm_medium=Email&utm_campaign=Principles)\nYou may not know the specific that will challenge you on these questions, but you will likely face **some challenge** to your principles or values.\nSo create a plan for how you will respond.\nHere's what I built to ensure I know which rules to apply:\n[→ Get this workflow on iOS](https://workflow.is/workflows/d9a748bf53bb46a3933bf8581ea51242?utm_source=Willpowered&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=Shape_the_Path)\n### **4\\. FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS!!**\nWhen you shape your path with a clear destination, expert directions, and your principles and guidelines to reach it — follow it!\nAgain, I know it seems obvious, but it will not seem obvious when You're exhausted, stressed out, and hit a bump in the road.\nThat's why we need a Checklist.\nWe need to remember the specific directions to follow we mapped out when we weren't tired, stressed and emotional.\nThe problem — I'll admit it — checklists are boring.\n-   They feel like a chore.\n-   And if they feel like a chore, you're not going to use them.\n-   And if you don't use them, the small things you miss will add up.\nLike it or not, **Checklists are the best tool you have for bridging the gap between where you are and where you want to be.**\n_Why_?\nBecuase Checklists...\n[\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5416af3ce4b0f910e3133ead/1492176056804-5BS1S7YOFW8YM5B7UK2P/image-asset.jpeg)\n](http://blogs.jamaicans.com/metinking/files/2009/01/overloadcartoon2.jpg)\n### ← Turn this\n### Into this →\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5416af3ce4b0f910e3133ead/1492176107587-RJN3LU3DQEFLHK8QEYC1/image-asset.gif)\nThey take the vast amounts of knowledge from experts, practitioners, and case studies, and put it into a framework that's **actionable**.\nBut it's not enough.\n**Just because something is actionable, that doesn't mean it's useful.**\nAnd that's why the path ahead for Willpowered is dedicated to taking Checklists one step further to the next step by...\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5416af3ce4b0f910e3133ead/1492176719633-WPG8KCWAQCSWEA732MJ1/image-asset.gif)\n### ←Turning this\n### Into this →\nView fullsize\n![GTD Dashboard.png](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5416af3ce4b0f910e3133ead/1492511862074-9FCI9T457I3X6WCHXLMC/GTD+Dashboard.png)\nSo your path is clear, your progress is tracked, and the next step on [your journey to greatness](http://academy.willpowered.co/p/consistency?utm_source=Newsletter&utm_medium=Email&utm_campaign=Shape_the_Path) takes nothing more than a click.",

      "content": "I've said it before, and I'll say it again on this blog...\nThere is nothing special about me.\n_Throughout school, I was a B student..._  \n_I was never talented at sports..._  \n_And my English teachers would laugh if they knew I made a living from writing._\nHowever, this lack of talent forced me to learn several crucial life skills:\n1.  I had to develop a strong work ethic.\n2.  I had to practice habitually.\n3.  And I had to learn how to learn.\nBut I never would have developed these skills without one crucial factor:\n> I'm willing to look stupid.\nAnd it is better to look stupid than perfect.\n## **WHY WE AVOID LOOKING STUPID**\nThe desire to be liked by the crowd [is in our DNA.](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/evolution-of-willpower?utm_source=Willpowered&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=Stupid)\nWe survived the [harsh living conditions](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/built-for-focus-and-deliberate-practice?utm_source=Willpowered&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=Stupid) of our ancestors by sticking together in a tribe.\nDue to our unique ability to work together, the tribe was safe. To maintain our place within it, we tried to show our strengths and hide our weaknesses.\nThanks to social media, showing your strengths and hiding your weaknesses is easier today than ever before.\nYou can craft the exact persona you want to show the world — and don't need to reveal your vulnerability.\nIf I don't want you to see the areas in which I am weak or ignorant, I can leave those off my Facebook \"[highlight reel](https://www.facebook.com/colin.robertson.18007).\"\nWith enough time, effort, and filter selection, I can make it look like I'm living a perfect life.\n_Why admit to the world that I had to move back in with my parents, when I can just highlight the fact that I'm a published author!_\n_Why take a chance, start something new, and risk falling flat on my face?_\n**_Why look stupid, when I can look perfect?_**\n## **THE BIG PROBLEM WITH LOOKING PERFECT**\nNobody is perfect.\nWe all have flaws. Being imperfect is part of being human.\n**We all know this.**\nSo trying to look perfect will only isolate you from your friends and from reality.\nRather than confront your issues, your weaknesses, and become more self-aware — **your strategy will become denial.**\nYou will begin to avoid anything that reveals your weaknesses, you will run away from challenges, and you will cover up anything that doesn't fit your idea of perfection.\nEventually, you will spend the majority of your time and energy hiding your flaws — rather than improving them.\n## **IMPROVING YOUR FAILURES**\nWhenever I tell someone that I create content for a living, it's usually followed up with some version of the question,\n> \"...that's your full-time job?\"\n**I don't blame people for asking this question.** Of the dozens of content creators I have met over the years, there are fewer than five I know who do it full-time.\nSimply put, this is a tough way to make a living.\nBeyond being a struggle to make rent each month, you are consistently putting yourself out there to be judged by the world.\n_You are setting yourself up for constant criticism — especially from the person you see in the mirror._\nAs [Ta-Nehisi Coates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ta-Nehisi_Coates#Awards) — winner of the [MacArthur genius grant](https://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2015/09/2015-macarthur-genius-grants-announced/407758/?utm_source=SFTwitter) — said:\n> \"The challenge of writing is to see you horribleness on the page. To see your terribleness and then to go to bed.\n> \n> Then wake up the next day, and take that horribleness and terribleness and refine it. And make it not so horrible and not so terrible.\n> \n> And come the next day and make it...not so bad. Then go to bed the next day and make it maybe...average.\n> \n> Then after one more pass, if you're lucky, maybe you get to 'good.'\"\n_And this is coming from a writer who was so good that he won **The Genius Grant!!**_\nIf he's claiming that at best he produces something that is merely \"good,\" what chance do you and I have to produce anything worthwhile?\nSlim to none — but there's still a chance.\n**The difference comes down to your will to look at your own failures**, your own weaknesses, and your own stupidity. Then come back the next day and make your flaws just a little bit better.\nIt is in this state of mind which I have thrived.\n## **MY STUPIDITY — AND WILL TO IMPROVE IT.**\nWhen I started Willpowered I had a simple goal:\n> Write 1,000 words every day.\nI knew that I could not control my talent for writing; I could not control who would come to my site and I could not control whether or not people would relate to my message.\n**But I _could_ write 1,000 horrible, terrible, and embarrassing words today.**\nThen the next day, I could write 1,000 words that were just a little bit less horrible, less terrible, and less embarrassing.\nThen do the same the next day...and the next.\nI have now almost written 1,000,000 words — But I'm still horribly embarrassed by every first draft I write.\nBut I am less embarrassed by the drafts I write today than the ones I wrote last year. And I know I will be even less embarrassed by the drafts I write next year at this time.\nI will never write a perfect article, a perfect paragraph, or even a perfect sentence — _but that's not the goal._\nThe goal is to write 1,000 words per day that help you understand abstract scientific concepts and use them on your journey to become your best self.\nAnd no matter how stupid I may look to myself or others, **I will do everything I can to make that happen.**\n## **CONCLUSION — MAKE YOUR WORRIES CONCRETE**\nMuch of our concern about \"what people will think\" comes from our [fear of the unknown](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/fear-kills-willpower?utm_source=Willpowered&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=Stupid).\nI still worry every time I publish a new article that I'm going to get \"hate mail\" from a subscriber who was shocked and offended by the horribleness of my writing.\n**This worry, however, only exists in the unknown.** I've written over 200 articles, and have only received 1 harsh email that really stung — which was over 2 years ago now.\nSo when I receive a subscriber email, I force myself to open it up and read it.\nOtherwise, my mind will wander to negative places about what it might say — despite the 99.5% chance that it will be positive or constructive.\nWhenever you're worried about what people may think when you, \"put yourself out there,\" **use that as a cue for action.**\nIt won't be easy at the moment, but if you can summon the courage to open yourself up to criticism, **you will find that it's better to look stupid, than perfect.**",

Make the unsubscribe link as hard to find in the email as possible.\n2.  Naming it something other than \"Unsubscribe\" so it confuses you.\n3.  Then if you do make it to the unsubscribe page, adding options so you only unsubscribe from the particular category that you just received.\nThey spend their time doing all of this instead of...I don't know...\n> Working to improve their content!!\nNope, they'd prefer to make life miserable for the people who had the audacity to sign up for their email list and support their work.\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5416af3ce4b0f910e3133ead/1487929603796-95EX9L11T3FYZFKWDW79/image-asset.png)\n_Anyone else see something wrong with this picture?_\nIf you are a content creator, marketer, etc. who has done this in the past, I understand. It is a noisy world, and you want to do whatever you can to get an edge to get your voice heard. And this is a very tempting way to improve your metrics.\n> But this is a waste of your time, skills, and intelligence.\nAnd it will only end up hurting you and your subscribers in the end.\n## **HOW TO AVOID THE PRACTICALITY TRAP**\nMarketing is just one example, of course.\nIn your life, I'm sure there is a practical solution you can think of that goes against your principles or what is best for the long term.\nThe best way to avoid this trap is to remember what your real goal is.\nWhen I faced the temptation above, I reminded myself that **my total number of subscribers doesn't matter.**\n> What matters is how many people find my work valuable when they apply it to their daily lives.\nWith this goal in mind, my total subscribers — or unsubscribers — does not give me any information on how well I'm progressing.\nA much better measure is the click-thru rate.\n> How many people click the link from my email because the idea resonated with them?\nThat metric is the only one that matters when it comes to the email list — so that's the one I focused on.\n_And what happened?_\nWell, a \"good\" click-thru rate is somewhere around 2-3% in my industry. But I've been steadily increasing mine to 13.6%\n![Click-Thru Rate.png](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5416af3ce4b0f910e3133ead/1487862832647-JIEV0SFLO7E0NIG6LMTR/Click-Thru+Rate.png)\n**4X better than the benchmark for my industry.**\n_How did I do it?_\n> BECAUSE I DIDN'T WASTE MY TIME PUNISHING MY SUBSCRIBERS BY CREATING A CONFUSING UNSUBSCRIBE PROCESS!!\nInstead, I spent my time...  \n_Learning who my subscribers were..._  \n_Discovering my true value to them..._  \n**_And writing better content._**\nNone of these things provided immediate results — but they are the reason I'm able to wake up every day and do work I'm passionate about for the rest of my life.\nAll because I put [principles](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/principles-benefit-willpower?utm_source=Willpowered&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=Principles) before practicality.\n## **CONCLUSION**\nUntil the day I die, I will always have a short term, viable solution, that is practical at the moment, but goes against my principles.\nBy recognizing this, I was able to continue making long-term, disciplined decisions; even when I faced moments of desperation.\nA practical, short-term, easy way out will always be there to tempt you. The next time you notice it, just remember...\n> Principles before practicality.",

KNOW YOUR GOALS**\nIn the fall of last year — as I was [building Wilson](https://willpowered.reverberation.co/p/build-a-digital-employee/?product_id=240951&coupon_code=SUBSCRIBERS) — I was finding it harder and harder to find time to:\n-   Write 1,000 words/day\n-   Exercise for an hour/day\n-   Keep in touch with my Chicago friends\n-   Explore things to do in my new hometown of Saint Petersburg\nWe all face situations like this. You probably have different specific goals than I do, but I'm sure you have at least one of the following:\n-   Creative goal\n-   Health goal\n-   Relationship goal\n-   Appreciate life goal\nFaced with all of these priorities, the first thing you want to do is\n### **2\\. BE CONCRETE AND SPECIFIC**\nMost people have these goals in mind, but they aren't concrete about what exactly they want and — more importantly — why they want to achieve them.\nNotice that my goal wasn't to \"write more.\" It was, \"write 1,000 words/day.\" And the reason why I want to write is clear in my mind — it's my creative outlet.\nWhatever those nagging goals in the back of your mind are, **make them concrete and purposeful.**\nYou don't necessarily have to write them down, but you do need to know what you want to achieve and [why you want to achieve it.](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/start-each-goal-with-why?utm_source=Newsletter&utm_medium=Email&utm_campaign=AND_not_OR)\n### **3\\. IS IT WORTH IT?**\nThe next step is to simply ask yourself if your concrete goal and the purpose behind it is worth the effort it will take to achieve.\nWith my goal to keep in touch with my Chicago friends, I realized that I would have to venture outside of my comfort zone and ask my friends to chat on the phone.\nI'm not sure what your experience is with phone calls, but **I had never really just called a friend to chat**. In my circles, it's just not what guys do.\nSo setting up regular phone calls was new territory for me — and my friends.\nBut then I asked myself the question I always ask when venturing outside my comfort zone — _is it worth it?_\nIf the answer is \"yes\" to that question — whether it's a small thing like being the one to awkwardly ask another dude to chat on the phone, or a big thing like writing and publishing a book then you need to..\n> Let go of the need to whine, complain, or find excuses; and **focus all of your energy on making it happen.**\nIf it is worth the effort, then you'll only cause yourself pain and suffering by complaining.\nSo remember your purpose, remember that it's worth, and focus on finding the solutions — not adding more problems.\n### **4\\. IT'S (DATE) AND YOU ACCOMPLISHED ALL THESE GOALS. _HOW DID YOU DO IT?_**\n> It's the end of the day and I just wrote 1,000 words, exercised for an hour, had a great conversation with a friend, and explored a new area of town...how did I do it?\n🤔...🤔...🤔\n_I biked to one of the national parks nearby, went for a hike, used the dictation tool on my phone to write the first draft of this post, called a friend to catch up, then biked home._\n**Yup, this actually happened.**\nThe first draft of this post and more like it were written through a dictation tool on my phone while I was hiking in a new area of town.\nIf you check \"[My Dashboard](https://gyrosco.pe/Willpowered/fitness/?utm_source=Willpowered&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=AND_not_OR)\" on the navigation bar at the top, you'll see that I've averaged over 20,000 steps per day by doing this.\nPlus, I also found that:\n-   I'm more creative when I'm hiking & dictating rather than typing\n-   I write at least 2x faster\n-   I don't have to worry about the [health consequences](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/double-creativity-productivity-through-scarcity?utm_source=Willpowered&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=AND_not_OR) of staring at a computer screen or typing on a keyboard\n-   I have explored more of the city than people who have lived here their whole lives\n-   I'm more polished in professional phone calls because I get \"practice\" time by calling friends.\n_And all of these are just the bonuses!_\n## **A MULTI-TASKING CAUTION**\nIf you've been reading my work for a while, this post may seem confusing to you.\n> To be clear, I'm not suggesting that you multitask. I'm suggesting that you focus your effort on achieving multiple goals at once.\nHere's the key difference:\nOne of the best ways to hit multiple birds is to **start biking to work.** — _Think about all of the birds you hit!_\n-   You improve your fitness\n-   You improve your health\n-   You save money on transportation\n-   You practice building healthy habits\n-   You reduce your carbon footprint\nI could keep going...\nYou accomplish ALL these things at once — _but would you consider biking to work, \"multitasking?\"_\n> NO!\nIt's a simple activity that will help you accomplish more with less.\nA multi-tasker, by contrast, would try to do work while on an exercise bike at the gym (which he probably drove his car to). I'm not sure about you, but I would struggle to do either of those activities well.\nWhich is why...\n> Multi-tasking is like trying to hit two birds with two stones in one throw.\nGood luck with that.\n## **CONCLUSION**\nOne of the biggest mistakes people make is **believing that something needs to be _This OR That._**\nIn my experience, **90% of the time you can accomplish _This AND That_** — and maybe even \"the other\".\nThe difference between the two comes down to discipline.\n_It takes discipline to follow the steps I outlined above._\n_It takes discipline to understand how you can accomplish 2+ goals at the same time._\n_And it takes discipline to **follow that understanding with action.**_\nI won't lie, however, sometimes you really can't make AND happen. I have faced situations where AND led to overextending myself and losing control over my situation.\nBut there are at least 9X more instances where I found a solution that not only allowed me to do this AND that — but infinitely more other things like the bonus points above.\nSo the next time you complain that you \"don't have time\" to exercise, spend time with family, OR cultivate your passions — pause.\nThen follow the steps above to **find the way to exercise, spend time with family, AND cultivate your passions.**",

      "content": "When you think of the great entrepreneurs through history, there is one name that is almost certainly going to come to mind —[Henry Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Ford?utm_source=Willpowered&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=Simple).\nFord is thought of by many to be the \"father\" of the auto industry...**but why?**\n_Did he invent the first car?_\nNo...\n_Did he invent the internal combustion engine?_\nNo...\n_Did he have the best design or greatest parts in the marketplace?_\nNo...\nFord was relentlessly driven to succeed, but he was far from a genius.\nSo if he didn't invent the car, the engine, or design the \"best\" model on the market, _why is he so highly regarded today?_\nBecause Ford knew a profound truth — **simpler is better than better.**\n## **THE POWER OF SIMPLICITY**\nFord took one of the most complicated and technologically advanced products of his era and made it simple enough for uneducated workers to manufacture.\nHis factories provided jobs to thousands of working class people. His assembly line ran so efficiently that Ford pioneered the 8-hour workday. [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Ford#Model_T?utm_source=Willpowered&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=Simple)\nHis [Model T](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Ford#Model_T?utm_source=Willpowered&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=Simple)was the embodiment of the incredible feats humanity can achieve when we combine the rigor of science, with the innovation of entrepreneurship.\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5416af3ce4b0f910e3133ead/1486651692101-Z2OE00QJ2QDDOJO7JPI8/image-asset.jpeg)\nThanks to Ford, a whole class of people were able to experience a rich, beautiful world beyond the limits of their horizon.\n## **THE ENEMY OF SIMPLICITY**\nThanks to the efforts of Henry Ford and the many great minds who followed, today's world is limitless.\nDespite all of the problems we face, **we are living in an unprecedented time of opportunity for individuals to create their future.**\n_So why doesn't it feel that way?_\n> Because we are overwhelmed by the greatest enemy of simplicity — ambiguity.\nNobody can predict the future. Change is happening faster than ever and is only accelerating. Since there are an infinite number of directions the world can go from here, we are left paralyzed by the equally endless opportunities at our disposal.\n**To continue with the car analogy, imagine you're about to enter a car race.**\nYou can choose from 10 unique and technologically advanced vehicles, which are all specialized for various roads and conditions (winding roads, muddy roads, flat roads, etc.).\n**But here's the catch — there's no map!**\nEveryone starts on a dirt road, but nobody knows what the conditions will be for the majority of the race. So nobody knows which car will prove to be the most useful.\nFor all you know it's going to be nothing but dirt road for the entire race so you should get a four-wheel-drive.\nUnless, of course, it's nothing but flat pavement — then you're going to feel pretty taking four-wheel-drive over the sports car...\nWith all of these choices and so much unknown, _which car do you pick?_\n> This choice is on the mind for many people in my generation.\nThere are so many great options, but we have no idea which one will even be viable down the road, **and we're terrified of picking the wrong one.**\nIf you can relate to this...\n> The worst decision is not picking the wrong car; it's wasting precious time and resources constantly trying to find a \"better\" car.\nThat is why simpler is better than better.\n## **HOW TO FOCUS ON SIMPLICITY**\nLet me start by saying, I'm no master of simplicity yet.\nI still suffer from overconfidence and sometimes lose discipline to stay within my core strength (see my articles on addiction).\nHowever, by using the simple techniques below, I vastly improved — and continue to do so.\n### **1\\. FIND YOUR HEDGEHOG**\nOver the last six years, I've had a clear purpose in mind — To discover the intersection of my talent, passion, and value. [This article](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/discover-passion-ability-and-value?utm_source=Willpowered&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=Simple) goes into detail on each significant step.\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5416af3ce4b0f910e3133ead/1486651240847-SXJWJ5W5MQEHF7IDZY7G/image-asset.png)\nThe mere fact of getting closer and closer to this point with each passing day gave me the confidence to stay on the path — even when I hit setbacks and Made poor decisions.\nDo the [hedgehog exercise](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/confront-the-brutal-facts?utm_source=Willpowered&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=Simple) yourself. You don't need to know what the connection is yet. You don't need to be fantastic in every area yet. You do, however, need to be authentic in your answers.\n### **2\\. CHOOSE OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN YOUR 3 CIRCLES**\nOne of the biggest mistakes people make when choosing the right opportunity is skipping the hedgehog step and immediately trying to determine the best option.\n> In an uncertain future, what does \"best\" really mean?\nIf you have a general idea of your Hedgehog, best is the option that is as close to the intersection of your three circles as possible.\nIf you jump immediately into comparing your opportunities, however, your mind will use societal conventions like money, prestige, or \"coolness\" of the opportunity to judge its value.\nWhile all of these may be valuable, **they will distract you from evaluating factors that are more important to you;** such as work hours, learning opportunities, and what you want out of life.\nWith your hedgehog in mind, however, it will be obvious which positions will allow you to combine your passion, talent, and value — while tuning out the distractions.\n### **3\\. DETERMINE YOUR PHILOSOPHY**\n> In an uncertain, unstable, and unpredictable world, you need a simple idea that will give you strength and stability to push your comfort zone.\nIf nothing comes to mind right away, try to think back to a challenging time in your life when you found the inner strength to rise to the occasion.\n_Why did your mindset shift?_  \n_What ideas helped you persevere?_  \n_How can you put those ideas into a clear guideline for the future?_  \nFor example, my philosophy is [to confront the brutal facts, yet never lose faith](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/confront-the-brutal-facts?utm_source=Willpowered&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=Simple).\n**Confront the brutal facts**represents my passion for science, discipline, and neverending quest for the truth — even when it's tough to hear.\n**Never lose faith**represents my passion for entrepreneurship, perseverance, and unwavering belief in the greatness at the heart of every individual.\nMaintaining this simple philosophy has provided the flexibility to adapt to ever-changing circumstances, and the consistency to keep moving forward.\n## **Conclusion**\nSix years ago I read these words from one of my heroes, [Jim Collins](http://www.jimcollins.com/?utm_source=Willpowered&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=Simple):\n> \"In today's world, change is both constant and accelerating. This is neither good nor bad. It just is. Like gravity.\"\nIn such a world it is impossible to know which opportunities will be the best down the road. So instead of focusing on \"the car,\" you must focus instead on \"the driver.\"\nFind the simple concepts that will work for you and be ready to adapt to a changing world. Because, despite all of the problems we face, **we are still living in an unprecedented time of opportunity for individuals to create their future.**",

      "content": "There are two things I'm sure everybody reading this has experienced at some point:\n**Failure & Guilt.**\nEverybody has tried...  \nEverybody has failed...  \nAnd everbody has felt guilty about letting friends, family, or themselves down.\n_But does feeling guilty really motivate you to \"get back on track?\"_\nTo find out, psychologists Claire Adams and Mark Leary invited young women who were watching their weight into the laboratory and encouraged them to eat doughnuts and candy (for of science, of course). [1](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/short-term-and-long-term-motivation)\nAlthough the experiment seemed cruel, it led to a profound insight to the question:\n_Will people indulge in less junk food if they forgive themselves?_\n**Most people, including me, will find that question absurd.**\n_If people don’t feel guilty, then what is stopping them from eating ALL of the doughnuts and candy?_\n_How will they hold themselves back if they don’t feel bad about giving up on their diets?_\n## **THE EXPERIMENT**\nTo find the answer, the researchers separated the dieters into two groups:\n1.  A “feel guilty” group\n2.  A self-compassionate group\nThey told each group that they were going to take part in two studies:\n-   Study #1: How food effects a person's mood\n-   Study #2: A simple taste study of different candies\nIn the mood study, each group was asked to finish a chocolate or glazed doughnut within 4 minutes. Afterward, they washed it down with a full glass of water.\nThe combination of the doughnut and the water **made each woman feel both guilty and uncomfortably full at the same time.**\nBefore the second study, the self-compassionate group received a message to help relieve their guilt.\nThe note read:\n> \"Sometimes participants feel guilty about eating a whole doughnut, but you shouldn't be too hard on yourself about it. Remember that everyone indulges sometimes.\"\nThe “feel guilty” group didn’t receive any message — leaving them to embrace their guilty thoughts and feelings.\nThen, for the second study, the researchers gave both groups three large bowls of candy:\n-   Reese’s\n-   Skittles\n-   Peppermint Patties\nThey asked each group to sample some candy from each bowl and rate it. They were encouraged to eat as many candies as they’d like to achieve a “definite rating.\"\n## **THE RESULTS**\nAfter each group of women had eaten the candy, the researchers weighed the bowls to measure the difference.\nHere are their averages:\nSelf-compassion group — ate 28 grams of candy\n“Feel guilty” group — ate **70 grams** of candy\n> Feeling guilty led to almost 3x more binging!\nSince then, researchers have repeated similar experiments with consistent results.\n_Feeling guilty always leads to letting loose._\n## **WHY FEELING GUILTY DOESN’T WORK**\nNow, you may be thinking:\n> \"Okay, maybe this works for others, but I know that I need to feel guilty! Otherwise, I won't learn my lesson!\"\nThat's certainly a fair concern, so let's take a look at what happened in the brains of the two groups of participants.\nWhen each group broke their diets by eating the doughnut, then made it worse by feeling bloated from the water, they activated an area I call [\"The Primitive Brain.](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/short-term-and-long-term-motivation)\"\nThe Primitive Brain is all about the short-term. It is where cravings for food, sex, and even shopping sprees get their motivation.\nBy feeling guilty, the dieters were unknowingly fueling it. \\[[5](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.anthro.32.061002.093158)\\]\nHowever, when the other group received a supportive and rational message that _everyone indulges sometimes_ they could see their situation with greater clarity. It wasn't the end of the world.\nTheir mental activity stimulated the rational, \"Modern Brain\" — which is responsible for self-control and discipline.\nBy seeing a guilty situation objectively and forgiving yourself, the situation remains under your control. \\[[2](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.anthro.32.061002.093158)\\]\n## **ALTERNATIVES TO FEELING GUILTY**\nMany of us have become so used to feeling guilty when we slip that thinking about an alternative seems strange.\nSo I laid out three scientifically proven strategies that you can use to rebound from a setback and stick with your goals:\n### **1\\. WHAT WOULD YOU TELL YOUR BEST FRIEND?**\nImagine your best friend just had a bad day and skipped their diet or exercise routine.\n_What advice would you give them?_\n_Would you try to make them feel guilty about what they ate?_\n_Would you call them lazy and hopeless for skipping the gym?_\n**Of course not!** You know intuitively that making them feel worse won't help. Right now, they need your support to stick with it for the long-term.\n_Are you any different? What would your best friend tell you?_\nWhen we think about helping our best friends, we gain perspective on the reality of our situation. This is why we give our best friends better advice than we give ourselves.\nWe let go of the short-term emotions, which helps us think clearly. [6](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12-n3IE87UWDCiA81y4Z5lEv1DFiciUWUhFCdya7MgV0/pub)\nThe next time you start to feel guilty about a setback, pause.\nThink about what you would tell your best friend if they were in your situation. The advice you give him or her may be the difference between a slip, and crash.\n### **2\\. MAKE DELIBERATE MISTAKES**\nThe first long-term goal every one of us sets in life is far from easy...\n_Learning how to walk._\nFrom the moment we saw the grownups walking upright, it inspired us.\nFor months we tried and failed. We fell again and again, but did our parents make us feel guilty about it?\nNO! (At least I hope not :/)\n**Babies somehow understand that falling is part of the process.** It is a necessary setback that every person deals with when learning how to walk. When we fell, we got back up.\nEventually, we started walking on our own — taking each step with pride.\nUnfortunately, many of us forget this crucial life lesson and start worrying about being judged as a \"failure.\" _So we don't even try._\nAny goal worth achieving is going to [push you out of your comfort zone.](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/learning-zone?) And just like learning how to walk, you will fall. Sometimes it will be your mistake, somtimes it will be bad luck.\nYou can't always will yourself to success — **but you can will youself to get up.**\nWounds heal for a reason. When they do, it's time to try again — not wallow in guilt.\n### **3\\. KEEP A PROPER PERSPECTIVE**\nI've honestly lost track of how many failures I've incurred over the last 8 years as an entrepreneur...\n_But there's no question that having to move back in with my parents was the hardest._\nI had worked so hard for so long, and it felt like a big step backward. It was a shining example of my failure as an entrepreneur.\nThat was my \"fall down\" perspective.\nHowever, through another perspective, moving back home was a sign of my refusal to quit, my willingness to suffer through the embarrassment, and do whatever it takes to save my dream.\nThat was my \"get up\" perspective.\n**Both perspectives were important.** It would do me no good to deny the reality of my situation, try to defend my lifestyle to the outside world, and get comfortable living there.\nEqually, it would do me no good to feel sorry for myself, feel guilty about failing, and accept that I was just a loser.\nEventually, I struck the right balance between the drive to get out of there ASAP, and the confidence I needed to make it happen. [6](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12-n3IE87UWDCiA81y4Z5lEv1DFiciUWUhFCdya7MgV0/pub)\nAdditionally, seeing myself through both lenses helped me overcome my insecurity. We don't like to think about, talk about, or even admit the truth about our insecurities.\n**Insecurities reveal our weaknesses, failures, and fears.**\nThis leads to a horrible downward spiral as we try to cover up our negative traits, and talk only about our successes. This makes us feel even more guilty about failure when we inevitably hit bumps along the road.\nEveryone falls. Everyone hurts. **Not everyone gets back up.**\nThose that do, learn that falling down isn't the opposite of success — it's a part of success.\n## **CONCLUSION**\nI realize this is all easier said than done.\nOur brains are always wary of how others may judge our success and failures. That judgment was once the difference between the safety and security of the tribe, and facing the wild alone.\nThus, we all have an internal judge who makes us feel guilty whenever we don't live up to its standards of perfection.\nDefeating this internal judge is no easy task. I doubt anyone ever silences it completely. But understand that you are not imprisoned by your guilt. You have a choice.\n_You can choose to think about what you would tell your best friend._\n_You can choose to make mistakes — because they’re part of the process._\n_And you can choose to keep everything in the proper perspective._\nWhen you fall, **you can choose to get up.**\n[\\[Sources\\]\\[5\\]](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12-n3IE87UWDCiA81y4Z5lEv1DFiciUWUhFCdya7MgV0/pub)",

Take more time to \"enjoy life\"\n**I always started off great.** \nI'd stick with the routine for two or three weeks and feel confident _this time_ I was going to make all of my new habits last.\n_But the burnout always came eventually..._\nI'd wake up exhausted, skip the gym, skip my diet, and be on the slippery slope toward skipping another year of progress...\n**This is the false promise of intensity.**\nIn order to make a \"real change,\" we need to completely overhaul our lives with maximum effort. But in the end, we usually end up right back where we started...or worse.\nThe willpower, determination, and belief that \"this time\" will be different that we all feel with the promise of a New Year are all valuable resources that will motivate you to reach your goals...\n> And focusing on intensity is a terrific way to squander them.\nIn 2013, I was tired of squandering the promise of a New Year.\nSo I followed [Jim Collins'](http://www.jimcollins.com/?utm_source=Willpowered&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=SMaC_Formula) strategy from [_Great by Choice_](http://amzn.to/2ilvPVp)_,_ and implemented my [_SMaC Formula_](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/create-a-smac-formula?utm_source=Willpowered&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=Consistency) _(_a \"Specific, Methodical, and Consistent\" list of habits to complete every day).\n_That decision changed everything._\n## **THE SMAC FORMULA**\nAlmost every success I've had over the last 4 years traces back to my SMaC Formula:\n1.  Wake up every weekday at 4 AM\n2.  Plan my transportation ahead of time\n3.  Follow my exercise plan\n4.  Log the food I eat\n5.  Log the cost of the food I eat\nThat's it. Just achieving these 5 points daily led to great habits to reach my goals.\n## Goal Progress %\nPlus, I didn't achieve any of those 5 points perfectly — especially not at first.\nI simply marked down \"Achieved\" or \"Failed\" at the end of the day.\nBy doing so, I killed 4 birds with one stone:\n1.  **I learned how to build new habits.** The strategies in books like [The Power of Habit](http://amzn.to/2iIQAqh) are terrific. But the only way to truly learn something is through experience. Filling out my SMaC Formula every day taught me how to build every other great habit since.\n2.  **I learned from failure with an objective perspective.** i.e. Discovering that I skip the gym more at night because there are more distractions. Easy switch to the morning, and I don't have to feel \"hopeless\" or \"lazy.\"'\n3.  **I achieved more than I thought was possible.** Consistency creates a snowball. With every push, the results grow bigger and bigger. As long as you keep pushing, they grow beyond what you thought was possible at the beginning of the year.\n4.  **I set new goals based on my progress, not my enthusiasm.** We see our future selves as a superhero with more time, energy and willpower than Superman himself. So, we set unrealistic goals...and fail them. By tracking my progress, I overcame this flaw and set goals that I knew were possible. \n## **THE CHALLENGE**\nAfter that, consistency became my \"go to\" strategy.\n1.  I used it to reach the [Top 10 of the Spartan Race](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/spartan-race-lessons?utm_source=Willpowered&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=Consistency)\n2.  I used it to build an audience of [30,000 Willpowered subscribers in 6 months](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/willpower-publishing-book?rq=lessons%20in%20willpower)\n3.  I used it to [write The Will of Heroes](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/willpower-publishing-book)\n4.  I used it to [learn how to build WILSON](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/failure-to-freedom?utm_source=Willpowered&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=Consistency)\n5.  And I will use it to achieve my ultimate purpose: **to help individuals use the tools of science and technology to take control of their future.**\n## CONCLUSION\nI'm not sharing these things to brag, I'm sharing them to do my best to convince you to resist the temptation of quick results this year.\nThe passion, ambition, and hope that you feel with the promise of a New Year are resources too precious to waste. \n> Overhauling your life through intense effort is THE FASTEST way to turn those resources into exhaustion, frustration, and hopelessness.",

      "content": "On November 4th, four days prior to Election Day, President Obama sat down with Bill Maher to discuss some pressing issues the country faced. \n_\\*Note: I'm just using this as an example, this isn't about either man's politics._\nTo my great delight, one of the first discussion points was of [great importance to me](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/confront-the-brutal-facts?utm_source=Willpowered&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=Listen):\n_How do we find a way for the truth to get eyeballs?_\nAnd I was very intrigued by their answers... \nMaher's solution:  **Get the profit motive out of the media.**\nObama's solution: **I don't know the solution yet.** \nI couldn't believe it. The President admitting that he didn't have the solution? Regardless of your feelings about the man; in today's world, admitting ignorance is bold.\nHowever, to truly fight for the truth, you must admit that you don't have all the answers.  \nWhich is why my #1 Rule in life is:\n> **Listen. Understand. Act****.** \n##   \n**THE RULEBOOK**\nOver the course of my entrepreneurial journey I've developed several \"rules\" to follow no matter what. \nThey serve as my guide for making [confident decisions](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/decisions-waste-willpower?utm_source=Willpowered&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=Listen) in a world of uncertainty.\n**Entrepreneurs are explorers.** We venture into new territory to see if we can find anything of value. I find this process immensely rewarding, but it comes at a price....\n_The fear of the unknown._\nThe uncertainty of venturing into the \"wilderness\" causes me a lot of head-scratching, a lot of second-guessing, and a lot of self-doubt.\nOf course, we all face these feelings. We know they're painful, they're uncomfortable, and even confusing. But ignoring them won't make them go away. So rather than ignore these thoughts, I trained myself to _listen to them._ \n## **LISTENING**\nDespite what you may think, listening is about more than \"being a good listener,\" in conversations.\nListening is embracing your inner curiosity and being aware of the \"whole picture.\" \nWe get so lost in thoughts about a problem we're struggling with right now, that we don't see the opportunities right under our noses.\nInstead of worrying whether someone will like you, try to listen to their body language as they approach you.\n_What is she/he communicating to you before either of you even say a word?_\n_How are you reacting?_\n_How might this non-verbal communication affect your conversation?_\nThis process may sound judgmental, but consider what most of us do in a conversation. We assume we must say certain things and act a certain way in order to get the other person to like us.\nWe turn our attention inward, thinking about what we need to do to make a good impression. \nListening, however, is a deliberate choice to turn your attention outward.\nYour focus is on the person, the subtext, the environment, the opportunities, the list is nearly infinite. Doing this will train your mind to be more open to learning, creativity, and _even luck._ \nBefore moving on, watch the clip again with a greater awareness of what each man is _really saying_. Try to see \"whole picture\".\nNotice anything different? What seemed \"off\" to you?  .\nAfter you've taken the time to listen to the clip again, try to come up with questions or insights based on what you observed.\nListen to the facts, _then try to understand them._\n## **UNDERSTAND**\nBelow are the key points I picked up from the conversation and the questions I used to gain deeper understanding of each man and his approach to the problem.\nHere's what I found:\n### **1\\. Bill Maher's solution sounds good, but he clearly didn't think it through.**\n-   Did he not think about how his solution would actually work?\n-   Would they lock me up for posting scientific information on my blog?\n-   What about a reporter who also has a book for sale?\n-   Or the thousands of self-published authors?\nThis is one of the biggest mistakes people make by **talking before understanding.**\nIf you already have a solution in your head, your [primitive brain](http://willpowered.co/learn/short-term-long-term-motivation?utm_source=Willpowered&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=Listen) will lead you toward confirming evidence, and away from questions that challenge your solution.\n### **2\\. The President, doesn't claim to have the answer, but clearly understands the situation better than Maher.**\n-   _Aha, so there is a difference between having an answer and understanding the problem._\n-   _I wonder what led to the difference in mindset between these two?_\n-   _Is it possible that others with useful insights are drowned out by those who believe they know the answer?_\n-   _I've been working on this problem for over a year now, perhaps I should share more of my progress and be more aggressive in getting it \"out there.\"_\nThis was the first time it hit me that I needed to pull back the curtain and share as much of what I understand as possible — and so do you.\nUnfortunately, there are those who do not understand your field, skill, or experiences as well as you do. Yet, they will be more than happy to act as if they know it even better.\nNot because they're bad people, per-se, but because it's second nature for most people to focus immediately on finding the right answer — instead of finding the right question.\n### **3\\. Neither man is asking the right question.**\n-   Maher is asking, \"how do we get the media to focus on the truth instead of ratings?\"\n-   _But is a focus on ratings the root cause of the problem?_\n-   _Are people even getting the truth from the media?_\n-   _Obama is asking, \"how do we make the truth entertaining?\"_\n-   But is the truth being \"boring\" really the issue?\n-   Do people ignore the truth because it's not entertaining enough?\n### 4\\. **There's a big opportunity here.**\n-   Obama cares about this issue.\n-   His mind is open to a solution (he didn't need to pretend he had an answer).\n-   It will be hard to get on his radar, but for all I know, I'm the closest person on earth to finding the solution he's looking for.\n_Okay, I need to figure out that formula and prepare for the moment when he is ready for it. What's the worst that can happen?_\nThis process may seem ridiculous — but these were my thoughts as I was watching the clip.\nI didn't plan to see an opportunity when I turned on the interview, I just thought it would be interesting.\nOpportunities and insights are all around us. We don't need \"more luck\" we just need to pay attention to the luck that's hidden in plain sight.\n## **ACT**\nLess than two months after watching that interview, I had tinkered and toiled my way [to a working prototype](https://www.mindomo.com/mindmap/listen-understand-talk-bdf0253d13df47bf9c3ebf91f8df9b74), and potential solution to the problem.\n**If you're still with me, I'd love to share it with you.**\nHere is the step-by-step process I took form the interview to the prototype.\nI went into a lot of detail, so feel free to skim.\nYour browser does not support frames.

      "content": "Facts.\nWhen I was a teenager, there were few things I feared more....\nNot because I hated doing my homework — because they were a reminder that I _was not_ the person I aspired to be.\n**I've always been a dreamer.** Thinking big, taking risks, and fear of the unknown have never been a problem for me.\nMy problem is getting my ability to keep up with my aspirations — and admitting the hard facts along the way.\nNowhere was this more apparent than when I moved to the US at 14.\n## **IGNORING THE BRUTAL FACTS**\nI arrived in Omaha, Nebraska, at the agree of 14 with a dream of playing in the NFL. Like usual, nobody understood why I was doing it.\nI was merely average on my Canadian team where the caliber of players doesn't even come close to America. On paper, I didn't have a hope of even getting playing time — let alone going pro.\nTo me, however, the choice was obvious — I would never make it to the NFL playing in Canada. So if I wanted to try, this was my only shot. Thus, I arrived with nothing but hopes and dreams...\nThen I met reality. Otherwise known as \"DJ Jones\" a real future NFL player — who usually had a running start at me.\nFor those of you unfamiliar with high school football in the U.S., each school has a varsity and junior varsity team. The better players play on the varsity team...\nI was on junior varsity. But I didn't start, I wasn't the backup, I was the backup’s backup!\nMy role on the team was to be a tackling dummy for the varsity team.\nThey needed players to practice against without worrying about injuring them. For the next two years, I was their guy.\nSo much for my dreams of the NFL...\n## **DECISION**\nAt the end of the season, I had a tough decision.\n_Is it worth it to play again next year?_\nOn paper, the decision didn't seem too hard:\n1.  My best friend just quit.\n2.  I had no realistic shot at a starting position.\n3.  We just finished our second consecutive losing season and hadn't won the State Championship since 1983.\n4.  I had a job, girlfriend, and college to prepare for.\nThe information was clear: \"Quit!\" _But was I ready to give up on my purpose of me moving to the US in the first place?_ _Was I just going to throw the last 2 years of pain out?_ _Or did I have what it takes to prove that I can play with the best?_ It wasn't easy...but I decided to finish what I started. **It was the best decision I've ever made.**\nOver the next year...\n1.  I earned a spot on the team\n2.  I started every game\n3.  Our underdog team upset the state and won the championship\n4.  And I learned the fundamental principle at the base of my philosophy toward life since\n### _\"Confront the Brutal Facts, Yet Never Lose Faith.\"_\n## **CONFRONT THE BRUTAL FACTS**\nThis was not an easy principle for me to grasp.\nThroughout high school, my denial of any facts that didn't match with my dreams led me to become a compulsive liar.\nI lied to my parents... I lied to my friends... But mostly, I lied to myself.\nAt the root of my dishonesty was having these big dreams, not having the ability to reach them, yet refusing to give up.\nI felt like I needed to constantly justify why I took huge risks and stuck with them.\nWithout good answers, I exaggerated, misled, or outright made up stories to justify my decisions. Lying became so habitual that I was halfway into a lie before I even realized what I was doing.\nIt was just a part of life — and it made me miserable. Nobody could trust me, and I couldn't trust them.\nWhen you're lying to everyone, you believe everyone else is lying to you. This leads to a cycle of mistrust, lies... you get the picture.\nLuckily, that started to change when I finally had face facts.\nThis was the first time I could not ignore the facts, If I wanted to reach my goal, I could no longer lie to myself.\nWhich is why the first fact I faced was...  \n## **BRUTAL FACT #1: Self-Awareness Is the First Step Toward Self-Improvement**\nSelf-awareness is the most underrated aspect of working toward any goal. Simply being honest about how much I was exercising didn't allow me to cut corners anymore.\nSimilarly, rather than trying to defend my weaknesses, I started seeing them for what they were —- problems in need of a solution.\nSome I could fix quickly, (like studying offensive formations) some would be much harder (like improving my speed). Being \"okay\" with my weaknesses started a fundamental shift in how I saw the world.\nWhen I could admit I wasn't as strong or fast as my teammates, I realized that I had a big advantage over them in playing disciplined. I still wasn't the best player, but I was dependable and consistent.\n**That's what ultimately landed me the starting role.** Most people do their best to ignore the hard truths of their situation because they believe it will lead to even scarier facts hidden underneath.\nBy thinking this way you will miss out on all of the positive things you'll find out about yourself or others in the process of owning up to your mistakes and learning from them.\n> If you have a brutal fact that you've been ignoring, ask yourself what positive findings may come from \"pulling back the curtain.\"\n## **BRUTAL FACT #2: Exaggerating Diminishes Your True Accomplishments.**\nWhen I held up the championship trophy after such a long, hard journey; I realized that by exaggerating, I disrespect the real hard choices that went into that achievement.\nExaggerating sends the message that \"I don't believe I've accomplished enough in my life to be worthy of your approval, but maybe adding this on will make up for it.\"\n> If you're ever tempted to exaggerate, try to think about what you're hoping to achieve from doing so — why do you believe this person will like you more if you exaggerate rather than tell the truth?\n**Don't judge yourself for the answer, just clarify it.**\nYou'll be surprised how effective this exercise is, and how silly your answers will sound.\n## **BRUTAL FACT #3: The Only Truly Bad Decision Is One Made Out of Denial.**\nIf you look back on the key decisions in your life, you'll notice there weren't many between a good and bad option. After all, in those cases, it's not much of a decision.\nInstead, we face a never-ending series of compromises and tradeoffs from having many good options in one case, and many bad options in another.\nUnfortunately, we all face choices that may hurt someone we love — like choosing to leave home in pursuit of a dream.\nOr whether or not to give up on that dream when it feels like nothing is working out the way you hoped.\n**In these cases, there really is no \"right\" decision.**\nMaybe I would have been better off staying in Canada.\nMaybe I would have discovered my passion for science and entrepreneurship if I didn't play my senior year.\n_Who knows?_\n_Who cares?_\nThe only decisions I regret are those where I lied to others, lied to myself, or simply ignored the facts I didn't want to hear.\nLife is not a math exam. There are very few absolute answers. We all struggle with making the right decision — because none of us know what it is!\nSome of your decisions may hurt people but that doesn't mean they're wrong, and you should feel guilt or regret.\nMore important than whether a decision might hurt someone is choosing to respect that person with the honest truth of the situation — especially if that person is you.\n> In those moments, you must become aware of the situation and ask yourself — are you being honest with the respect they deserve?\n## **BRUTAL FACT #4: Never lose hope.**\nIn November of my junior year of high school, things looked bleak.\nDespite all my ambition, I was a terrible football player, on a mediocre team, and lied to myself and others in order to justify myself. I was completely miserable.\nLooking back, though, I'm incredibly grateful that things were so bleak. Because it taught me that even if everything seems to be working against you, and your world seems hopeless...\nYou not only have the power to get back on your feet, but achieve far more than many thought possible.\nTo do so, however, **you must be willing to confront the brutal facts.**\nToday, I see fear, anger, and hopelessness from people all over. But far more troubling is our unwillingness to face the brutal facts of our reality — both good and bad.\nThe world is changing — rapidly. Change scares us because it's unpredictable. We don't know how to act today to protect ourselves tomorrow.\nThis natural fear will be our default response if we aren't willing to ask, _\"why?\"_ and confront each fact we find buried underneath.\nIf you look at the major changes over the last 50 years, you'll see that the changes aren't coming from multinational companies hell-bent on taking over the world.\nThey're coming from individuals who now have the power to open a laptop and access the knowledge, skills, communities and even funding necessary to pursue their purpose in life.\n_I am deeply grateful for all the individuals that pushed our society forward to help me do just that_ — and equally saddened to learn that **more than twice as many 18-29 year olds are more frearful than hopeful for the future.**\n> When we ignore the brutal facts, we never find the facts that will give us hope.\n## **BRUTAL FACT #5: The Truth Needs Our Help.**\nI wrote this post because I wanted to share my struggle to confront the brutal facts — and how they set me free.\nYou would not be reading this article right now if I hadn't confronted the brutal facts, yet never lost faith.\n-   10 years ago it was to play another year of football.\n-   5 years ago it was to start my first restaurant marketing startup.\n-   3 years ago it was realizing I was in the wrong industry.\n-   2 years ago it was starting Willpowered.\n-   1 year ago it was accepting the fact that at the age of 26 I had to move back in with my parents.\nIt's embarassing admitting that, but the truth is, I'm not ashamed of it. Last year I faced a difficult choice: quit, go part-time, or move back home.\nIt was difficult, but to me it was obvious: **giving less than everything I have to something I truly believe in isn't an option.**\nAs far as I'm concerned, quitting, going part-time, or any other derivative would be quitting on every person who has supported my work, and every other person who has found any kind of value in my work.\nToday, I feel the same about the truth.\nIf I only gave you the \"facts\" that made me look smart and successful, then I would be quitting on the value that allows us to trust each other and work together to overcome the real problems ahead.\n> It's uncomfortable being vulnerable, but it's miserable being dishonest.\n## **CONCLUSION**\n_\"You have to be the change you want to see in the world.\" — Gandhi_\nI firmly believe in Gandhi's words — because they're true.\nGenuine change doesn't start with politicians, it doesn't start with inspirational speeches, it starts with a woman refusing to give into an injustice by giving up her seat on a bus.\n**Actions speak louder than words.** In her action, Rosa Parks showed more strength than one can put into words.\nMy greatest fear is that we will forget facts like this. That we will judge people for what they say, not what they do, while we simply lay down and accept, _\"we live in a fact-free world now.\"_\nI won't do it.\nOver the past 6 months, I've been building a platform with a big dream of bridging the gap between scientific fact and public understanding.\nBut I know if we're going to have a world of facts, honesty, and trust in one another, even my wildest dreams won't be enough to make it happen.\nIt will take the will of all of us to first and foremost **be honest with the person we see in the mirror.**",

They received lists with how many calories each part of their job burned – from folding towels to changing the bed.\nThe second was the control group. They received no exercise information so researchers could compare the difference in understanding of the facts.\nAfter four weeks, without any instructions to diet or change their behavior, the maids who knew the facts started losing weight — while the other group remained stagnant.\nBy changing their mindset Toward their daily tasks, they recorded seeing their work as good for their bodies better than hard on them.\nOver time, this new attitude toward their work led to incredible improvements in their health, happiness, and fulfillment in life.\n## **HOW YOUR MINDSET AFFECTS YOUR RESULTS**\nIf this change in mindset seems heart believe, I don't blame you.\n\\*If they're doing the same work, why does a change in attitude matter?\nAre you trying to say that if I believe pizza is good for me, all of a sudden it will become healthy?\\*\nUnfortunately, no.\nChanging your mindset is not about magic wishes that come true.\n**It is about choosing to see the benefits from whatever challenge you're facing.**\nBoth sets of maids were getting a lot of healthy exercise through their work. However, the ones who saw their job as good for their bodies reaped the full benefits. [2](https://www.ted.com/talks/kelly_mcgonigal_how_to_make_stress_your_friend?language=en)\nBefore the experiment, the maids saw themselves as lazy or hopeless when it came to exercise. After all, they could not summon the willpower to make it to the gym or go jogging after work.\n_And after burning through 900 calories, can you blame them?_\nNow they saw themselves as regular exercisers and started acting in turn.\n-   They approached their work with more enthusiasm.\n-   They started walking more.\n-   \\*They began eating healthier.\nWith each day of work, they identified more with the regular exercisers they were in reality.\nThe other group of maids, however, just saw themselves as “working.”\n**This distinction is crucial.**\\[3\\]\nIf you feel overwhelmed, it’s going to require a lot of willpower to overcome that perspective and take action toward your goals.\nHowever, if you feel capable of handling the challenge, you will get an instant boost of willpower to rise to the occasion — as I learned two weeks ago.\n## **HOW I CHANGED MY STRESS MINDSET**\nI felt paralyzed as I sat down and stared at the screen...\nIt seemed like no matter what I just couldn't keep up with my work. I was over- promising and under-delivering. I was barely sleeping, I was missing deadlines, and didn't know how I was going to handle this.\nA downward spiral began as I had more work, less willpower, and less confidence in myself to get on top of everything.\nThe stress was mounting,\nThen I read Kelly McGonigal's book, \"[The Upside of Stress](http://amzn.to/2faQ87q),\" and everything changed.\nYes, that title is correct. Stress has benefits — [**plenty of them.**](https://www.ted.com/talks/kelly_mcgonigal_how_to_make_stress_your_friend?language=en)\nThe stress response (a.k.a fight-or-flight) is your body's natural reaction to challenges. It provides you with energy, focus, and awareness of the situation to help you rise to the occasion.\n_These are all exactly what I needed to get back on track!_\nHowever, our typical mindset toward stress is anything but, \"exactly what we need.\"\nSo when we feel the increased heart-rate, or rush of energy, we don't use it to our advantage. Instead, we try to fight it — and consider it evidence that we \"don't have what it takes.\"\nThis is exactly how I felt.\nHere's how things played out with a \"stress is bad\" mindset:\nMy body gave me a rush of energy and focus I saw it as a sign that I was incapable of handling everything\n-   I spent time and energy trying to fight off the response that was providing me with more energy\n-   With less energy, time, and adrenaline to meet the challenge, I cut back on sleep and other healthy habits\n-   Which led to even less energy and more stress to fight off Not exactly a winning formula...\nWhen I changed to a \"stress is good\" mindset:\n-   My body gave me a rush of energy and focus\n-   I saw it as my body helping me conquer the challenge\n-   I used the stress response to focus on one task at a time, and stick with it until it was complete.\n-   I used the time I previously spent fighting off stress to learn how to build an automation program to manage that task next time.\n-   Which led to more time, energy, and sleep in the future.\nThe change was incredible. And the results have been exponentially growing every day since.\nThis made me realize, even if the evidence in Dr. McGonigal's book was proven false, the results from choosing to see the benefits in stress were real.\nAs real as the declining numbers on the scale for the maids.\n## **CONCLUSION**\nYour mindset matters.\nIf you see yourself as an exerciser, it will require less willpower to act like an exerciser. If you see yourself as lazy, you will waste willpower just trying to prove yourself wrong.\nThat is why the right mindset is crucial — but it is only half the battle.\nYou can't have an \"exercier's mindset\" and expect to lose weight while laying on the couch. Remember, the maids were already active (_900 calories per day!_)\nTheir mindset changed their body's response to their daily activity and changed their behavior to eat healthier and get outdoors.\nSo find the benefit in any challenge you're facing.\nNo matter how hard, how stressful, or overwhelming it may be, you will _always_ be more likely to learn and grow from it with the right mindset.\n[\\*Sources](http://amzn.to/2faQ87q)",

      "content": "_It's hopeless..._\nI thought as I was 20 days into my 30-day [Kickstarter campaign](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/743524537/the-will-of-heroes/), but barely raised half of my $12,000 goal. \n_How am I going to double the money with only half the time?!_\nI didn't know the answer, but the objective was crystal clear: 10 days, $6,000, and the fate of Willpowered hanging in the balance. \nAt that moment, I became hyper-focused. \nI didn't have time to worry about things like sleep, fun, or even fear. My only concern was the mission and figuring out a way to achieve victory. \nThis focus was so powerful that I didn't even need the 10 days...I reached the goal in 5. \n**That is the power of scarcity.** However, that power comes at a price.\n## **WHAT IS SCARCITY?**\nEveryone reading this has probably faced a similar feeling of scarcity at some point in your life. \nIt feels like another \"you\" takes over. One who tunes out all distractions, becomes super productive, and makes the most of scarce resources like time, money, employees, etc. \nWhatever scarce resource resonates most with you, **the true measurement of scarcity isn't the lack of the resource itself, but the _feeling_ that you don't have enough of it.** \nA dieter and non-dieter may eat the same food, but only the dieter will feel as if it isn't enough. The same is true for money, time, or even friendships. \nYou will not experience scarcity unless you feel it.\n## **ADVANTAGES OF SCARCITY**\n### **1\\. Focus:**\nThe key factor of scarcity is how it heightens your focus. \nBeyond productivity, if you're gainfully employed and money is abundant, you don't need to focus on how much things cost. If you get fired, however, scarcity will be triggered and you will pay much closer attention to every expense.\n### **2\\. Prioritization**\nDeriving from that focus, you will begin to prioritize much more effectively.\nThe unemployed will find what is worth spending her money on and cut back on excess.\nThe college student who consistently put off a semester-long project will suddenly find the discipline to say \"no\" to parties or TV binges when his deadline is imminent. \nThese may become habits that stick with you even after the period of scarcity. \n### **3\\. Creativity**\nOften, focus and prioritization aren't enough to Get us through scarcity. So we need to find ways to use resources more effectively.\nAs I write this, I am using a feature called \"Hemingway Mode\" which does not allow me to delete any lines until my first draft is completed. \nI have a bad tendency of obsessing over each sentence, but because time is scarce for me, I need to focus on getting a rough draft done as efficiently as possible. Without that need to do more with less, I would waste countless hours continuing to obsess. \n## **Disadvantages of Scarcity**\nUntil recently, I believed in scarcity so much that I deliberately put myself in situations to achieve more with less – like I did with the Kickstarter. It's helped me a lot, and I see it as one of my main goal-setting strategies.\nUnfortunately, new scientific research has forced me to rethink that mindset. \nIn their book [Scarcity](https://www.amazon.com/Scarcity-Having-Little-Means-Much-ebook/dp/B00BMKOO6S/ref=sr_1_1?s=digital-text&ie=UTF8&qid=1476191911&sr=1-1&keywords=scarcity), [Eldar Shafir](https://www.amazon.com/Eldar-Shafir/e/B00EZQ8TAS/ref=dp_byline_cont_ebooks_2) and [Sendhil Mullainathan](https://www.amazon.com/Sendhil-Mullainathan/e/B00DWW4HWU/ref=dp_byline_cont_ebooks_1) illustrate how the advantages of scarcity can quickly turn negative – with serious consequences.\n### **1\\. Mental Bandwidth**\nIf you have been on a diet, you know how food suddenly becomes top of mind. \nYou become overwhelmed with things like calories, carbs, meals, what you ate before, what you'll eat next, and what you need to do to justify indulging \"just this once.\"\nIt is exhausting -- and now we know why. \nThe process of thinking about the scarce resource of food takes up mental resources and inhibits your performance on other tasks the same way talking on a cell phone inhibits your performance while driving.\nIf your stomach is growling, and you are trying to hold out for hours until your next \"allowed meal\" you will not be as focused at work, on your kids, or anything else besides that food.\nAt best, this will make the process of dieting a lot harder on both yourself and those around you. At worst, this will lead to ironic rebound. \n### **2\\. Ironic Rebound**\nNotice in the first point how the dieter was spending their mental resources focusing on food? In other words, focusing on the very thing they are trying to avoid?\nThis is the ironic rebound effect. Scarcity heightens your focus on the scarce resource. This can help you use it more effectively, but it can backfire easily. \n_Dieters can become more food obsessed._\n_Busy people can become disorganized._ \n_Lonely people can become desperate._ \nWhen we become so focused that it becomes an obsession, we end up shooting ourselves in the foot. \n### **3\\. Tunnel Vision**\nAs I read this book, I saw clearly how I displayed all these traits during times of scarcity. \n_But why wasn't I aware of them until now?_ _I pride myself on self-awareness, so how could I miss such obvious disadvantages?_\n**Tunnel vision.**\nAgain, the focus gained from scarcity causes you to dial in only on things that have to do with the object of scarcity.\nDuring the Kickstarter...\n_I hardly exercised at all._ \n_I completely forgot about appointments I set with friends and family._\n_And any thoughts of the long-term consequences of my decisions became irrelevant._ \n**I only saw the goal and what I needed to do to reach it.**\nThis tunnel vision goes beyond neglect; it can cause us to become downright foolish in our decision-making. \nIf a student is unprepared for a big test tomorrow, an all-nighter seems like a good idea -- even though she will be in an even worse position without sleep.\nWhen you need to pay a bill you can't afford today, a payday loan can look attractive. One creditor is demanding payment within the tunnel, and this new creditor is safely outside of it...for now. \nBefore you think you are immune to the irrational decision-making of a college student or the cash-strapped, think back to the last time you justified skipping the gym, skipping your diet, or hitting the snooze. \nNone of these decisions are rational, but they make sense when we our tunnel-vision is focused on our need for rest, food, and sleep.\n## **OPTIMIZING SCARCITY**  \n_What do I do now?!_\nI wasn't ready to give up on scarcity as a useful strategy, but clearly these disadvantages can't be ignored.\n_So how do we get the benefits without the negatives?_\nThe answer lies in a story from World War II pilots who were so sleep deprived that they accidentally lifted the wheels of the plane upon landing, rather than the flaps, and crashed onto the runway.\nThis was especially prevalent amongst bomber pilots who were crashing twice as much as fighter pilots. The Air Force was baffled. \n_Why are the bomber pilots making twice as many costly errors as fighter pilots?_\n**The military suspected there must be something wrong with the pilots.** So they immediately began work on training their pilots better, only recruiting the \"best of the best,\" and demanding better quality education in America. \nOne man, however, didn't examine the pilots, he examined the environment. \nHe found that the controls of the two planes were very different --particularly the location of the control for the wheels . \nFor the fighters, the wheels were deliberately placed away from the flaps. However, for the bombers, _they were right next to each other!_\nSleep deprived and exhausted, the bomber pilots accidentally pulled the wrong lever, lifted up the wheels, and crashed the plane. \nOnce they fixed that flaw, the difference in crashes evaporated. \n## **THE POWER OF ENVIRONMENT**\nThink about how hard it would've been for the Air Force to implement all of their strategies for \"better pilots\" for their planes.\nThey would need:\n1.  Buy-in from training officers to adopt new plans.\n2.  Support from Government officials\n3.  New training of recruitment officers\n4.  And a smaller pool of perfectly capable pilots to choose from. \nThey would've spent countless weeks, months, or even years coming up with strategies and experiments to implement this plan and make their pilots \"better.\" \nYet, all they need to do was change one control of the cockpit. \nNo buy-in, minimal funding, and once they did it, the problem was solved and they could focus their attention on much bigger issues. \n## **THE ONE AND OUT STRATEGY**\nWhen we feel the pressures of scarcity, we typically blame ourselves for not being able to live up to the demands of the moment. \n**We try to fix \"the pilots,\" rather than the cockpit.**\nWhile there are obviously things that you can be doing better, it's likely that somewhere in your environment there is at least one \"design flaw\" that can be altered quickly, simply, and drastically improve your results. \nFor example:\n**Keeping a food diary:** Even without denying yourself any food, writing down what you eat works far better than a diet because food doesn't become scarce. You become smarter about your food choices, not obsessed with them. \n**Apps/Tools:** Apps and tools that can increase your productivity, self-awareness, or organization require time and money to set up. But that initial investment can give you the benefits for months or years to come.\n**Reading the Manual:** It's so easy to neglect the value of [acquiring skills and knowledge](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/read-the-frickin-manual?utm_source=text&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=Scarcity) that will help you reach your goal. But if you take the time to learn about nutrition, exercise, how to use an app, etc. you will get infinitely better results. \nThese are all examples of what I call the \"One & Out Strategy\".\nThey require you do something once to set yourself up for success. After which, you can let it out of your mind. \nThis can be something as simple as dedicating part of your paycheck to savings before you even see it. Rather than depositing 10% of your income every paycheck, you make that one decision and don't need to worry about whether you're saving enough. \nExample from my life:\nGetting out of bed in the morning is difficult –even for a morning person like me. So I bought [Phillips Hue Lights](http://amzn.to/2eo4Qa7) and set them to turn on when my alarm goes off. And if I don't make it out in 10 minutes, they start blinking. \nIt's a lot harder to go back to sleep in a bright room, and a lot easier to get out of bed with a rush of adrenaline when the lights start blinking. I bought those lights once, and now I will save hundreds of mornings of struggle to get out of bed. \nWhatever your goal, ask yourself: \n_What change can I make to my environment once that will free my time, money, or mental bandwidth for months or years to come?_\n## **CONCLUSION**\nPlaying with scarcity is playing with fire. \nIt Isn't comfortable, it isn't fun, and it can also have some real consequences. However, the focus, prioritization, and creativity that you get from scarcity has made it one of the cornerstones of my philosophy.\nTo use scarcity to your advantage, you must find the things in your environment that you might neglect due to \"tunnel-vision.\" See if there is something you can do once, ensure you're on top of it, and let it out of your mind.",

      "content": "At 24 years of age, Mark Cuban was far from what many would call a success.\n_“I was living in a 3-bedroom apartment in Dallas. I didn’t have my own bedroom. I slept on the couch or floor depending on what time I got home._\n_I had no closet. Instead, I had a pile that everyone knew was mine. My car had the usual hole in the floorboard, a ’77 FIAT X19 that burned a quart of oil that I couldn’t afford every week.”_\nUntil that point, Cuban was working exclusively in the service industry. His prospects were poor, and he was mostly coasting through life, until he landed a job with Your Business Software – the first software retail store in Dallas.\nHe was excited to start a job that may lead to a good career, but he was also concerned.\n_“I had never worked with an IBM PC in my life. Not a single time, and I’m going to be selling software for it.”_\n**So Cuban decided to do his homework.** Each night, he would bring home a different software manual and read it – no matter how late it was.\nAfter weeks of reading the manuals, Cuban became the best salesperson on the team. He even knew more than his boss!\n_“Turns out not a lot of people ever bothered to RTFM (read the fricking manual), so people started thinking I knew my stuff.”_\nThis small detail – reading the manual – turned out to be the defining characteristic that separated Cuban from everyone else; not just in the sales team, but also in the marketplace.\n_“I knew I would end up owning my own business someday, so I figured my challenge was to learn as much as anyone about all businesses.\"_\nI believed that every job I took was me getting paid to learn about a new industry. I spent as much time as I could learning and reading everything about business I could get my hands on.” \nIt was not talent, luck, or a genius idea that took Cuban to the top – it was this small detail of reading the frickin' manual.\n_“Most people think it’s all about the idea. It’s not. Everyone has ideas. The hard part is doing the homework to know if the idea could work in the industry, then doing the preparation to be able to execute on the idea.” \\[[1](http://amzn.to/2cQ5kkc)\\]_\n## **FACE THE PAIN OF BOREDOM OR THE PAIN OF REGRET**\nIf Cuban's success really is this simple, why aren't more people listening to him?\n**Because reading the manual is boring.**\nNo matter how intelligent you are, nobody wants to pick up the boring textbook about Microsoft Excel and go through it step-by-step. Most of us would even choose an exhausting workout over that kind of torture. \nBut those who do find the willpower to understand the Excel manual have an advantage for life. They took the time to learn how to solve problems, while the rest of us try to work around them.\n**Giving them exponentially more time and skills to accomplish their goals.** \nThis is a lesson that finally hit home for me.\n## **LEARNING TO CODE THE RIGHT WAY**\nIf you have worked in the technology industry over the last 20 years, you know the value of a talented engineer. Partly because they're the ones _who actually build the products,_ but also because there just aren't enough of them.\nThis is completely ridiculous considering the value and almost assured high salary that come with the position. Plus, it is one of the few lucrative careers that anyone reading this has the tools and knowledge to begin working towards this very second.\nThe web is overflowing with online coding schools, forums, guides, etc. that are mostly all free and actually good enough to give you a \"foot in the door.\"\nThere's only one catch – you have to read the manual.\nUntil 4 months ago, I'd tried to learn how to code several times. I would read a little bit, go through a lot of trial and error, and then give up after my enthusiasm dropped and my errors grew.\n**But this time, I was determined to learn, and willing to embrace the boredom.** \nSo I started on lesson 1 [on this site](http://www.w3schools.com/) and took every boring step necessary to truly understand what I was learning.\n_Yes, it was hard..._\n_It was tedious..._\n_It was frustrating..._\n**_But it was worth it._** \nLearning basic code has made my life 10x easier. I've learned to automate literally hundreds of tasks, saving myself over 20 hours/week so far. \nThis article, for example, was completed in 2-3 hours less time than it used to because I built a customized app using _Alfred -- [an app that helps you automate your workday.](http://alfredapp.com?utm_source=Willpowered&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=Manual)_ \n[\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5416af3ce4b0f910e3133ead/1474370083764-1OMSNTS9EWRGC4RIGXBC/image-asset.png)\n](http://alfredapp.com?utm_source=Willpowered&utm_medium=Referral&utm_campaign=Manual)\n## **HOW TO FIND THE DISCIPLINE TO READ YOUR FRICKIN' MANUAL**\nUnfortunately, with my time split between 2 companies now, I don't have the hard scientific basis to answer this question that I usually do. \nHowever, what helped me win my fight with boredom was clear – **I had no other choice.**\n[Scarcity](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/double-creativity-productivity-through-scarcity?ref=Manual) is one of the most powerful strategies people rarely use. When you have a deadline, make a promise, or leave yourself no retreat, your brain stops focusing on distractions and starts focusing on solving problems.\nAnd after I made a promise to some of my heroes of science to develop a platform specifically for them by the end of Q3, I had to get it done. I had to learn how to code, and code well.\nThis mentality has stuck with me every day since and only grows stronger as deadline day is less than 10 days from now. And my \"problem-solver\" is firing on every cylinder. \nTo illustrate what I mean, as of Monday I still had about 2 full days worth of mindless data entry before the product was fully operational...and I didn't have 2 full days to spend. \nI stressed over this problem all of last week as I continued to put it off; hoping that I would find a solution...\nThen at 3:30am on Monday, I did. That's right, it was in a dream.\nI never thought that was possible before, but I shot out of bed, wrote a screen-scraping program to collect the data for me, and 2 days of boring, tedious work was accomplished in 30 minutes (plus I may never have to enter data again).\nIf you can create a situation where you \"have to get it done\" over the course of even just a couple of hours, **those hours will pay you dividends for a lifetime.** \n## **CONCLUSION**\nSometimes success is boring. It's boring choosing a trip to the gym over a night on the town, it's boring choosing a salad over pizza. And it's boring reading the instruction manual instead of picking things up as you go along.\nHowever, if you can embrace that boredom by reading the freaking manual you will set yourself apart from everyone else. It will pay dividends for years to come as you master the fundamentals and exponentially build your skills over your lifetime.\n**Sources:**\n1.

Who helped you along the way?\nThis simulation will help you identify the key points along the path from where you are to where you want to be.\n_\\*For help,_ [this checklist](http://www.willpowered.co/self-evaluation?ref=Unrealistic_Goals) _provides all questions to ask yourself at this stage._\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5416af3ce4b0f910e3133ead/1473701850943-GIRSYFO7THMOZUL48BT7/image-asset.png)\n* * *\n## **Step 2: Identify Milestones**\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5416af3ce4b0f910e3133ead/1473701998967-Z7H3OXC028DP2D8L4EB0/image-asset.png)\nWorking backward, identify the key milestones you reached between now and then.\nStart with the milestone that “sealed the deal,” then ask yourself,\n_What major obstacle or challenge did I conquer in order for me to reach that final milestone?_\nThen repeat for as many key obstacles that occur from where you are today to your goal.\n* * *\n## **Step 3: Next Steps**\nNow, that we have an outline, it's time to connect the dots. \nThis round, you want to go more detailed and simulate each step you took to get the milestones.\nBecause it's more detailed this time, you want to think about each step you took from where you are to the first milestone.\nThen you can give an estimate of when you will complete those steps and hit the first milestone.\nRepeat this process for each milestone on your path.\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5416af3ce4b0f910e3133ead/1473702530228-XCRUR5CEJFBEI6S6KJYZ/image-asset.png)\n* * *\n## **Step 4: How Did It All Go Wrong?**  \n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5416af3ce4b0f910e3133ead/1473702816202-OC4TEP9TIDMLLZKAXGZU/image-asset.png)\n### Now, it’s time to identify all the things that could go wrong.\nThis isn’t to make you feel bad about yourself, it’s to **identify everything that you need to be mindful of** going forward.\nAs [an optimist](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/stockdale-paradox), this is always the crucial step for me. \nIt’s far better to confront your weaknesses with calm, cool-headed planning, than when you’re tired and stressed from pushing your comfort zone. \n* * *\n## Step 5: Break It Into Daily Goals  \n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5416af3ce4b0f910e3133ead/1473703320669-QM9965ZSX8W4MVGH42C8/image-asset.png)\n## **Conclusion**\nOne of the most effective life strategies I've used is \"burning my boats\" and forcing myself into difficult situations.\nLeft with no retreat, your brain will switch _from thinking about excuses, to thinking about solutions._\nI haven't always been able to rise to the occasion – and failing in those situations hurts.\nThat's why I've been developing this method to help me learn, grow, and increase my chances of success. \nIf you ever decide to jump into a \"bigger pond\" I hope it helps you do the same!",

      "content": "In 1813, Humphrey Davy – a prominent British scientist, and a member of the Royal Society – damaged his eyesight in an accident with nitrogen trichloride. \n**It was perhaps the luckiest accident in modern human history.**\nDavy would be blind for months and in need of a quality assistant. When thinking about whom he would hire, he remembered a young man named Michael Faraday who sent him a 300-page book of notes taken during one of his lectures.\nIf that boy could take such meticulous notes during a lecture, surely he would be able to take note of everything while Davy was unable to see.\nIn 19th-century England, hiring Faraday was a radical decision. He was merely a bookbinding apprentice, from a poor family, without any formal education.\nSo the idea of Davy, one of the most respected scientists in England, entrusting him to perform all the complicated Scientific duties necessary of a lab assistant was crazy. \nHowever, trust him he did – **and society will forever thank him for it.**\nMichael Faraday did not just prove his worth as a competent lab assistant; he became perhaps the greatest scientist of all time. \n_He was the first to harness the power of electricity and store it in a generator._ \n_He created the first electric motor, which powered the 20th-century._\n_And his work laid the foundation for scientists like Thomas Edison, Nikola Tesla, and countless others to build the world we know today._\n**His list the contributions go on – and may never have happened without the luck of Davy's accident.**\nHow many great leaders, geniuses, and individuals capable of changing the world will never discover the greatness within them simply because they never had that luck?\nTo me, this is the greatest tragedy in the world.\nI know there are countless \"Michael Faraday's\" out there that are capable of building a better world for all of us, but the opportunity just isn't there for them. \nProviding these people with that opportunity is my \"WHY\". \n## **THE GOLDEN CIRCLE**\nWhen setting a goal, whether it is to exercise this week, or change the world, there's a very simple formula we usually go through to achieve it.\n1.  We start with what we want to accomplish.\n2.  We strategize about how to achieve it.\n3.  Then if we are lucky, we find motivation when we think about why the hard work is worth it.\nIn his book Start With Why, author Simon Sinek called this formula, \"The Golden Circle.\"\nIn nearly every problem we try to solve, or goal we strive to achieve, we follow this formula.\n![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5416af3ce4b0f910e3133ead/1470844183476-FC6891N6Z61OUNQ8K20H/image-asset.png)\n_Unfortunately, we usually approach the golden circle from the wrong direction._\n##   \n**STARTING WITH WHAT**\nOn the surface, starting with WHAT makes sense. _Shouldn't you know what you want to accomplish before you set out to achieve it?_\nThat is sound logic...if you actually know what you want.\nMost people who set goals do not know why they want to reach that goal in the first place. So when they hit the inevitable hard days along the way, they do not have the inspiration to push their comfort zone and achieve an excellent result. \nTo see this for yourself, ask someone who sets a New Year's resolution to exercise 4 times per week why they want to start working out. \nYou will likely get a puzzled look, followed by, _\"Uh...to get in shape?\"_\nIn contrast, ask someone who just finished her first half marathon this year why she wants to exercise 4 times per week, and she will say confidently, \"_this year I am training for a full marathon.\"_\nThe WHAT is the same, but the WHY is completely different.\nWhich is why we know she will finish that marathon, while millions of new gym members will not even make it to February.\n## **THE POWER OF STARTING WITH WHY**\n_“Hi Colin,   \nFirst of all thanks for your mail, but I cannot open your articles, I think this is banned in Sudan.   \nPlease is it possible for u to find a way to provide me these articles through any other source? I do not want to miss them.”_\nMy heart started racing when I received that subscriber's email at midnight on a Friday.\nI was coming home from a night on the town, but became so fired up that I did not just send him all of my articles, **I stayed up working until I physically could not stay awake any longer and fell asleep 4 hours later.** \n_Not because I used a productivity strategy._\n_Not because I ate high-willpower foods._\n_And not because I was seeking wealth, fame, or adoration._\n**But because it was a reminder of my WHY.**\nI honestly believe that this subscriber could be the next Michael Faraday. I believe he and all the other people of Sudan have greatness within them – and it breaks my heart that they are denied access to information that might help them discover that greatness.\nSo I wake up every day inspired to change that. To provide them and every other person on this planet access to reliable, expert-quality information that will help them learn, grow, and reach their full potential.\nWith this as my WHY, I have been able to push my mind, body, and spirit further than I thought possible.\n**Whatever your goal is, first ask yourself \"_WHY?\"_**\n_Do you believe it will bring you happiness?_\n_Do you believe it will benefit your family?_\n_Do you believe it will make a positive impact on the world?_\nThere are no right or wrong answers. What really matters is finding the WHY that will motivate you to persevere through all of the obstacles you will face along way.\nJust remember that finding your why is merely the starting place.\n## **WHY IS THE START, NOT THE FINISH**\nStarting with why will inspire you to achieve goals, help you bounce back from failure, and might even give you the confidence to change the world – **but you still need to put in the work.**\nUnfortunately, many people who start with WHY never figure out the HOW. They are the \"dreamers\" who never learn how to \"do.\"\n**Here are 2 strategies you can use to ensure you're not one of them.** \n### **Find People Who Know \"HOW\"**\nWalt Disney was once asked by a shareholder, \"what would happen to Disney if he was hit by a truck?\" His answer shocked the crowd.\n_“Absolutely nothing. My brother Roy runs this company. I just piddle around.”_\nHe was not kidding.\nShockingly, Walt Disney was not much of a businessman. In venture after venture, Walt kept failing – and racking up a lot of debt in the process. \nEventually, Roy Disney had to step in and run his brother's company. It was clear that Walt had no plans of giving up, and Roy feared that Walt would be taken out by loan sharks without his help. \nWalt Disney had a clear understanding of his WHY. He genuinely wanted to bring happiness and wonder to children. But to achieve a vision as grand as his, he needed to surround himself with people who knew HOW.\n### **Track Your Progress**\nI may never succeed like Disney, but I am just as much of a WHY person as him.\nI have always taken risks, followed my passions, and been able to see the [greater purpose](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/power-of-purpose) behind my daily actions.\n**But because my mind is on the grand vision, I usually gloss over the details.**\nThis is why I could never figure out how to build Willpowered into a sustainable living. I was motivated by why I was creating content, rather than learning how to create more valuable content, or analyzing the business side of things. \nTo counteract this tendency, I need to track as much information about my progress towards achieving goals as possible. When the brutal facts are right in front of me, they're hard to ignore.\nTo track my information, I use what I call a, \"SMaC Tracker\" that you can access for free by clicking the image below:\n[\n![SMaC Formula Checklist top.png](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5416af3ce4b0f910e3133ead/1472407577896-IU2CJYHSRZL248NI6FAN/SMaC+Formula+Checklist+top.png)\n](http://www.willpowered.co/s/SMaC-Formula-Template.csv)\nOr you can check out [this article](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/self-monitoring) which lists all the benefits of tracking your progress, and suggests tools to help you get started.\n## **CONCLUSION**\nThe biggest mistake people make with their goals is approaching them in the wrong direction. Before you determine WHAT you want to accomplish, **take the time to find your WHY_._** \nThe purpose, cause, or belief behind your goals will be the thing that motivates you to overcome the inevitable hard times along the way.",

But Bach loved the drink so much that he was willing to explore an entirely new genre–humor–and begin protesting through his music.\n_And he was not alone._\nCoffee has been the drink of choice of some of the [greatest geniuses throughout history](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/02/famous-coffee-drinkers_n_5358495.html). But these geniuses didn't just drink coffee, **they were obsessive about it.**\nBeethoven famously counted every single one of the 60 beans in his morning coffee. \\[[2](https://books.google.com/books?id=HnqbARD_8BYC&pg=PA52&hl=en#v=onepage&q&f=false)\\]\nBenjamin Franklin not only hung out in coffee shops before they were cool, but he was always sure to have extra coffee supplies while traveling at sea–believing it completely mad to rely on the captain to bring enough. \\[[3](https://books.google.com/books?id=954MAQAAIAAJ&dq=ben%20franklin%20coffee%20drinking&pg=PA254#v=onepage&q=ben%20franklin%20coffee%20drinking&f=false)\\]\nYet, none of these men even come close to the daily totals of Teddy Roosevelt, who drank an entire gallon, or Voltaire–who drank 40 to 50 cups! \\[[4](https://books.google.com/books?id=4O_RAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA557#v=onepage&q&f=false)\\]\nThere are countless more examples: Jerry Seinfeld, David Lynch, and Ralph Waldo Emerson just to name a few.\n_But is it the coffee that leads to genius? Or something else?_\n## **DOES COFFEE LEAD TO GENIUS?**\nIt started with the necessity.\nI was in my freshman year of college, and there just weren't enough hours in the day. So I needed to suck it up, drink the bitter tasting beverage I never liked (except in Frappuccino form), and study for my exams.\n**That's when my love affair with coffee began.**\nHardly a day has gone by since then without a cup in the morning, and I've slowly increased my total to 6 per day. Hardly Voltaire numbers, but it's safe to say it's above the average.\nAs I was slowly increasing my total cups per day, I noticed something else–my willpower, accomplishments, and success in life also increased!\n_But what role did the coffee play in this success?_\nFor that matter, what role did it play in the success of Beethoven, Benjamin Franklin, or Teddy Roosevelt?\nTo answer these questions, let's break down how coffee actually works.\n## **HOW DOES COFFEE WORK?**\nThe active ingredient in coffee is caffeine, which is present in many other foods and beverages from chocolate to Red Bull.\nWhen the brain uses energy to perform tasks, it creates a byproduct called adenosine. Adenosine acts like \"lactic acid\" in the brain and makes you feel tired. Caffeine blocks the effects of adenosine, making you feel more awake.\n_But does it actually improve performance?_\n**Unfortunately, the answer is not very clear.** the clear studies on coffee show that if you have been a coffee drinker for years, your performance is now practically dependent on drinking coffee.\nAlthough caffeine is not particularly addictive–it doesn't cause cravings or illness, just a headache–daily coffee drinkers will require caffeine in order to perform at their best.  \n\\[[5](https://www.amazon.com/Drugs-Without-Hot-David-Nutt/dp/1906860165)\\]\nThis explains why the geniuses listed above were so meticulous about their coffee.\nBeethoven was obsessive about counting his coffee beans because if he had fewer than 60, his creativity and skill as a composer would have suffered.\nInterestingly, if you're not a coffee drinker, trying to recover from a poor sleep by drinking a huge pot of coffee in the morning actually won't help nearly as much as it would a regular coffee drinker.\nBut you can take solace in the fact that despite spending hundreds or thousands of dollars every year on coffee, studies have found only a slight improvement in performance amongst daily drinkers. \\[[5](https://www.amazon.com/Drugs-Without-Hot-David-Nutt/dp/1906860165)\\]\n_So why, then, have all of these great thinkers throughout history been so obsessive about their coffee?_\n## **THE FUEL, NOT THE SPARK**\nBefore my love affair with coffee began, I had no real need for it.\nI didn't know what I wanted to do with my life yet. I wasn't a great student, and I had no real motivation to stay up late studying. So even if I drank 40-50 cups per day like Voltaire, I wouldn't have anything to use that energy boost on.\nHowever, once I started working towards my purpose in life, that's when coffee became a powerful ally.\nI used it to stay up late, I used it to wake up early. I used it to increase my afternoon focus and to summon the energy to go to networking events.\n**Coffee was the fuel of my purpose, not the creator of it.**\nI cannot say for sure, but I believe each of these geniuses used coffee the same way. It wasn't the coffee itself that made them geniuses, but it was a powerful tool to help them along the way.\nThis is why studies have only found a slight improvement in cognitive performance amongst regular coffee drinkers. Most people use coffee as a tool to get through the day, not to work through the night.\nIt's not the tool that makes a difference, it's why you're using it.\n## **START WITH WHY**\nSo often we read about a great strategy to lose weight, get a promotion, run a successful business, etc. When we see the strategy in action, we immediately credit it for the success.\n**In reality, though, most success tools, strategies, and resources are just like coffee.** They can help you reach a goal, but only after you gain a deep understanding of _what_ you want to achieve and _why_ you want to achieve it.\nWithout a genuine, inspiring purpose that you truly believe in, you can follow the success habits of great people all you want–but you'll likely end up in a never-ending loop of frustration as you fail with one strategy after the next.\n## **CONCLUSION**\nSeveral of history's greatest minds were avid coffee drinkers–even drinking as many as 50 cups per day! Some may look at these people and conclude that coffee will undoubtedly lead to success.\nHowever, when you take a closer look at the reason _why_ these geniuses drank so much coffee, you'll see that it was merely a tool used to help achieve success–rather than the cause of it.\nToday, you can learn about nearly all of the tools, strategies, and resources used by successful people. These may explain _how_ people can reach success, but they don't explain _why_ they became successful.\nThere are many paths that lead to success. So before you commit to one, make sure you gain a deep understanding of _what_ you want to achieve and _why_ you want to achieve it. Then decide whether coffee will help you along the way.\n[_\\*Sources_](/s/Coffee-Sources.pdf)",

      "content": "“There are two types of people in this world: hedgehogs and foxes.” wrote Isaiah Berlin in his famous essay.\nThe fox knows many things.\nHe is cunning and smart. He is fast and sneaky. He is always in search of new strategies to beat the hedgehog and win his share of the forest.\nThe hedgehog, on the other hand, knows one big thing.\nHe is simple. He uses only one strategy but executes it to perfection. Whatever the fox tries, the hedgehog defends himself with what he knows how to do best.\nSo when they face each other, the fox tries a new strategy, but the hedgehog always wins.\nNo matter what the fox tries, the hedgehog just curls up into an impenetrable ball, exposes his spikes, and thwarts the crafty fox — forcing him to retreat and come up with another plan.\nIn real life, foxes are those who always try new strategies to achieve their goals.  \nThey are always searching for the 8-week ab program…the 12-day juice cleanse…and consistently redefining their “dream job”.\n**Hedgehogs, on the other hand, are those who stick to a simple strategy.** Hedgehogs are consistent. They trust the process, and they methodically work towards achieving their ”dream job.”\n_This is Kobe Bryant using his insane work ethic to practice harder than any other basketball player, period._\n_This is Temple Grandin using her empathy for animals and ability to think in pictures to revolutionize the design of feedlots._\n_This is Warren Buffett passing on short-term gains from “boom markets” to focus on his long-term growth of 12% every year._\n## **HOW DOES ONE BECOME A HEDGEHOG?**\nI first learned about the hedgehog concept in [Jim Collins](http://www.jimcollins.com/)' book, [](http://amzn.to/2aEejp7)_[Good to Great](http://amzn.to/2aEejp7),_ which explores how companies go from mediocrity to greatness. He found that every great company, and the great people within them, approaches life with a “hedgehog strategy.”\n**It is simple, it is effective, and executed to perfection.**\nHowever, these strategies did not just come out of nowhere. They were deeply rooted self-awareness and understanding of what you are deeply passionate about, what you are naturally skilled in, and what drives your economic engine.\nView fullsize\nAll of us know the importance of these factors to some degree. Almost everyone has discovered at least 1 of these circles within themselves.\nMany people have even found the answer to 2 of them. However, unfortunately, that is where the vast majority end their search. There’s nothing wrong with discovering only two circles, but below we will explore why they will not lead to greatness.\n### **Passion & Value**\nIf you ignore your natural talent, and only focus on finding a job that you are passionate about, you won’t reach your true potential. You will not make a great contribution to society, and we will not get to see your unique masterpiece.\nThis would be like [Temple Grandin](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/temple-grandin-overcame-autism) choosing to work on a farm, rather than embracing her talent for design. She would've been perfectly happy, but she would not have revolutionized the feedlot industry, and become a hero for autistic children everywhere.\n### **Value & Talent**\nIf you only focus on what people will pay you for, and what you can become the best in the world at, then you will not be able to tap into the passion you’ll need to push your comfort zone and achieve something great.\n[Mozart](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/true-secret-mozart) nearly gave up his dream when his father Leopold demanded that he remain a court musician, rather than a composer. If he never summoned the courage to disobey Leopold, he may never write the music that defined his legacy.\n### **Talent** **& Passion**\nIf you focus only on what you can become the best the world at, and what you’re passionate about, then you will not learn how to create something that is truly valuable to society.\nThis would be like [J.K. Rowling](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/jk-rowling-rags-to-riches) giving up on Harry Potter after being rejected by 12 publishers, keeping the story in her personal journal, and never sharing the books that inspired millions of kids like me to start reading. \nMost people stop searching after discovering 2 of these circles. There's nothing wrong with that, as it will lead to a good life. But to achieve a great life, no matter what a \"great life\" is to you, you must continue to search for all 3.\n## **DISCOVERING ALL 3 CIRCLES**  \nAfter learning about the hedgehog concept, **I have been on a mission to discover all 3 of my circles.**\nIt has not been easy. But with each step, I'm getting a little bit closer to understanding how I can leave this world a little bit better than I found it. I'm writing about this today because I have taken a big step in the last month towards discovering my 3 circles.\nBut to provide context, and give you some concrete ideas for finding your hedgehog, I wanted to share my full journey...\n# **HEDGEHOG #1**\n![#1.png](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5416af3ce4b0f910e3133ead/1469647962089-R2ZP9P2DPY99OA25S89B/%231.png)\nAs you can see, the first concept was very generic. I was truly passionate about becoming a great leader who believed in creating something bigger than myself.\nI was also very disciplined and methodical in my pursuit of goals. So I believed that effectively using my willpower was my unique strength.\nFinally, I believed my value to society was to build a great company, with a great purpose...but unfortunately, I had no idea what that company would be.\n**None of these were wrong, but they were not specific enough to be effective.** I spent too much time focused on learning how to lead, how to run a startup, and how to understand team dynamics...rather than on the customer’s problem, or our solution. \nSo after 2 years, we simply didn't create enough value to stay in business…and my first hedgehog failed.\n![#1 Results.png](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5416af3ce4b0f910e3133ead/1469647810679-KCFCML2L6VFLSBBIKXXW/%231+Results.png)\n# **HEDGEHOG #2**\n![#.png](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5416af3ce4b0f910e3133ead/1469647713817-EWUGUGV6LLK1ZMGM1A60/%23.png)\nWhile reading startup business books and management books, I was also reading about how to become more productive.\n**This led me to my discovery of the science of willpower–****my true passion.**\nI was passionate about leadership, yes, but the reason I was so passionate about leadership it was because I wanted to help bring the best out of myself and others.\nNow I believed that the best way for me to do that was by teaching people more about their willpower and how to use it effectively. Not through motivational speeches, _but through science._\nSo I started pursuing a PhD in performance psychology with the goal of becoming a researcher, a professor, and author of the science of willpower.\nUnfortunately, I became restless and my life of academia ended quickly. I was ignoring my need for autonomy, tangible results, and practical application. **I was ignoring my inner entrepreneur.**\n![Results #2.png](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5416af3ce4b0f910e3133ead/1469649781448-FET2KIHFYU77XFEOQYXU/Results+%232.png)\n# **HEDGEHOG #3**\n![#3.png](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5416af3ce4b0f910e3133ead/1469648156856-DO98HCIO40KXY487VI7U/%233.png)\nWhile taking classes, I also began blogging on the science of willpower. My audience, while small, was growing and people were engaging. So I decided my next venture was going to be turning that blog into a business.\nI dropped out of my classes, took the money I saved for the PhD, and gave myself 6 months to figure out how to make a living off of Willpowered. That was 19 months ago. \nThrough that time, I discovered what it truly meant to be passionate.\nThere were a lot of chances for me to give up, stop trying to make Willpowered work, and move on – like I did with my first startup, and with academia.\n**But this time I _truly loved_ the work I was doing everyday, and I refused to give up on it without a fight.** \nI pushed my comfort zone, overcame my weaknesses, and grew as a person with each passing day. So even though even though my bank balance continued to decrease, my happiness in life only increased.\nThe brutal fact, though, is that happiness doesn't put food on the table.\nEven though I was learning and applying new skills to become a better researcher, writer, and entrepreneur – I was not providing enough value to fill that last circle of my hedgehog. \nSo as of last month, I had to give up working on Willpowered full time… I had to find a way to create more value.\n![Result #3.png](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5416af3ce4b0f910e3133ead/1469648313961-KT5Z3IO8JUH4Q024JRYC/Result+%233.png)\n# **HEDGEHOG #4**\n_This is wrong..._I thought as I read yet another blogger who was passing off his opinion as scientific fact. \nLike many others online, this author didn't cite any sources, link to any studies, or have any root in actual science. Worse yet, this person had an online course they were selling and also presented that as science!\n**I became infuriated.** \nHere was a person presenting himself as an expert only because he knew how to market himself online, _not because he was an expert._\nMeanwhile, my heroes of science _– who are experts –_ are selling themselves short by confining their ideas to a book, when modern audiences clearly want more content options online.\n**Then I had to take a hard look in the mirror to realize I was part of the problem.**  \nThe reason why thousands of you have supported my work until now is not that I'm the \"willpower expert.\" It's because I work hard to turn scientific research into compelling, relatable, and practical strategies packaged into the content you find valuable.\n**At that moment, everything clicked. I found my hedgehog.**\nI discovered the idea that lies entirely at the intersection of my passion, talent, and value I can bring to society.\nI am building a platform that connects content creators who are always finding new, innovative ways to package their ideas into valuable online courses, with the actual experts of that content who have no idea these audiences even exist – and just how valuable their expertise truly is. \nWith the end goal to provide reliable, expert-quality information, presented through innovative, engaging instructors – to give every individual the opportunity to learn, grow, and achieve whatever greatness they seek.\n![#4 Hedge.png](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5416af3ce4b0f910e3133ead/1469648239167-2O840OYGXYDZMBHRXB9H/%234+Hedge.png)\n![#4.png](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5416af3ce4b0f910e3133ead/1469648354530-RYZ0JSMSDVWTA0COD5Z3/%234.png)\n## **CONCLUSION**\n_Good is the enemy of great._ Since I first read those words, I've tried to live them every day of my life.\nI've constantly been searching, experimenting, and working toward finding the intersection of my passion, talent, and value–_and I believe that now I have found it._\nThis is just the beginning, obviously, but the combination of my passion, talent, and value is crystal clear.\nI cannot believe that I spent the last month sharing an inspiring vision with my heroes. One where their life's work is more valuable than they ever imagined, and where we can ensure that the best ideas, not the loudest voices, are the ones heard by the public.\nNow I wake up every day believing that with great scientists and entrepreneurs by my side, together we are going to change the world. All because I didn't settle for \"good.\"\n**So I wrote this post as a challenge for you to begin searching for your 3 circles.** \nWhatever your definition of greatness is, if you discover the intersection of your unique passion, talent, and value to society, you will leave this world a better place than you found it.\nI look forward to seeing what you accomplish.\n## **Resources to help you find your hedgehog**\n### Video\nJim Collins on the hedgehog concept\n### Audio \n### Self-reflection Questions\nAt the end of every year, I've asked myself these questions to increase my self-awareness and get closer to my hedgehog. As Jim Collins suggests, I've found it helpful to research myself as if I were an entirely new species to help gain better perspective.\nSee if these questions help you:\n_1\\. What does this species do on a daily basis?_\n_2\\. What has it accomplished over the last year?_\n_3\\. What has it accomplished in its lifetime?_\n_4\\. What does it do differently than any other bug?_\n_5\\. What can it be better than any other bug in the world at?_\n_6\\. How is it a useful part of the ecosystem?_\n_7\\. Why is it here? What is its purpose?_\n[_\\*Sources_](/s/Hedgehog.pdf)",

      "excerpt": "In 1959 Vince Lombardi finally got the chance he had worked all of his life for - he was now the head coach of a [National Football League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League) (NFL...",
      "content": "In 1959 Vince Lombardi finally got the chance he had worked all of his life for - he was now the head coach of a [National Football League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Football_League) (NFL) team.\n**Unfortunately, that team was the** [**Green Bay Packers**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Bay_Packers)**.**\nIn those days, Green Bay was the NFL equivalent of [Siberia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siberia). It was a horrible team, in an unknown city, and was almost as cold as Siberia as well!\nBut Lombardi was grateful for the position.\nHe grew up in New York as the son of a poor Italian immigrant. This meant Lombardi would face discrimination for most of his life. Back then, Italian-Americans were thought of as hard workers but, unfortunately, were also thought to be \"dumb as dirt\". \nSo they were simply not entrusted to be head coaches. This meant Lombardi was forced to languish as a mere high school coach for years. Despite his remarkable results, he was not even considered by many programs at the next level. \nLuckily, one man was willing to see beyond the stereotypes.\n[Red Blaik](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earl_Blaik), the head coach at West Point Military Academy (also known as Army), finally offered Lombardi a job to run his offense after witnessing the man’s brilliance.\nAfter being given the position, Lombardi seized his moment. He worked tirelessly to create _the best_ offense in all of college football. **And he did.**\nIn Lombardi's first 2 seasons with Army, they only lost 1 game! They were among the best offenses in the country, and Lombardi was sure that these results at the college level would be enough to earn him a head coaching position.\nNope.\nLombardi was continually turned down for head coaching jobs he was qualified for. Then one interviewer simply told him, “you’d better look around and find something else. Because I’m convinced no one is going to hire an Italian head coach.” \\[[1](http://www.amazon.com/When-Pride-Still-Mattered-Lombardi/dp/0684870185/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1449072184&sr=1-1&keywords=vince+lombardi+biography)\\]\n## **OPPORTUNITY**\nFor 5 years, Lombardi would languish as he saw his less-qualified peers continue to get the jobs he felt he deserved.\nThen a glimmer of hope finally came. He was offered the assistant coaching job at the New York Giants in the NFL. Still not his ideal head coaching position, but at least he would be coaching at the highest level.\nIn the NFL, Lombardi was able to put his skills on display for the entire nation. In his second year with the Giants, he led them to the championship game in what would be called “[The Greatest Game Ever Played](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1958_NFL_Championship_Game)”.\nAfter that season, Lombardi felt he could no longer linger as an assistant coach. It was time to become a head coach - no matter how terrible the team was.\nThen, Lombardi got his bittersweet victory as he was offered the head coaching position in Green Bay.\n## **LOMBARDI’S DO OR DIE**\n_“Uh Dad, Green Bay isn’t even a city on this Map.”_ \n_“Don’t worry, when I’m done with this team, it will be.”_\n**Lombardi inherited a terrible situation in Green Bay.**\n_The team finished last season in dead last._\n_They had 10 consecutive losing seasons and were only getting worse._\n_And the once proud franchise was considering moving away from the city._\n**Things were bleak, but Lombardi was not phased.** He came to the team with a passion and drive that shocked them. He had worked so hard to get to that point, and he knew that if he failed, he would never get another chance.\nIt was do or die. For the Green Bay Packers, and for him. So he walked into his first team meeting on a mission saying:\n_\"Gentlemen we are going to relentlessly chase perfection. Knowing full well we will not catch it because nothing is perfect. But we are going to relentlessly chase it. Because in the process we will catch excellence. I'm not even remotely interested in being just good.\"_\n**This speech captivated the team.** Especially the starting quarterback, Bart Starr, who said, \"I couldn't even sit in my chair I was so excited!\"\nThen the team got to work. They worked harder, longer, and with more intensity than any other team in professional football.\n“I’ve done 2 boot camps in the marines. And those didn’t even come close to how hard Lombardi’s practices were. We couldn’t believe it, we just thought this guy was crazy.” Said Gary Knafelc, one of the star Green Bay players.\n“Guys would lose consciousness right there on the field. There was vomiting and it wouldn’t be uncommon to see a guy just keel over,” said Gary Kramer, another player on the team. “He wanted every once of ability you had, and he would not relent until you gave it to him.”\nTypically, this type of coaching is done at the high school or collegiate level when players need to learn discipline and get into better shape. But it was unheard of to put professionals through this kind of torture in practice.\nHowever, all of the hard worked paid off. In their first season, Lombardi turned a hopeless team into a winner \\- finishing the year with 7 wins and 5 losses.\n_It was do or die, and Lombardi did._\nAfter that, the Green Bay Packers became a perennial powerhouse. The very next year, they made it all the way to the NFL championship game, falling just 9 yards short of a touchdown that would have secured the victory.\nBut that would prove irrelevant. As they would win 5 championships over the next 7 years – something no other team has done in NFL history. In the process, the city of Green Bay became nicknamed \"Title Town\", and Vince Lombardi became legendary.\n## **HOW VINCE LOMBARDI BECAME LEGENDARY**\nVince Lombardi is arguably the greatest coach there has ever been in the game of football. His name is written into the trophy given to the Super Bowl champions every year, and the city of Green Bay is infinitely greater thanks to him. \nGiven this, it is unbelievable to think about just how close he was to never even becoming a head coach at the collegiate level. \nSo, let's unpack the Lombardi story to see how he was able to overcome the prejudices of his era, and become legendary.\n### **1.    NOT SETTLING FOR “GOOD”** \nAfter the Green Bay Packers lost to the Philadelphia Eagles in Lombardi’s first ever championship game, he addressed his team after the game was over:\n_“Gentlemen, we got beat today. But I can tell you right now, we will never lose a championship game again.”_\n**And they never did.**\nThis response represents how Lombardi responded every time he was passed up. All of those times he was passed over for head coaching positions, or was even told, “no one is going to hire an Italian head coach,” he never accepted that fate.\nEven though he was a successful assistant coach, he never settled.\nHe knew he could lead a team to greater heights as a head coach. It was his destiny. So he never celebrated coming second, he held onto the pain of not reaching his true potential, and used it as motivation to push even harder.\nIn life, we are given countless opportunities to settle for the good things we have, rather than work for the great things we know are possible. Then we justify settling for \"second place\" because second place is practical. \\[[2](http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/1973-26817-000)\\]\n**Do not be seduced by this path.**\nThere is no shame in settling for a comfortable life if that is what you truly want. But be honest with yourself – if you dream of more, do not lose sight of it.\nDon’t settle for what’s practical, work for what’s possible.\n### **2.    BEING DEEPLY PRINCIPLED** \nVince Lombardi did not stick to the status quo.\nHis first speech as a head coach was to a team that finished dead last in the entire league. **Yet he was talking about chasing perfection!**\n_What right did a first time coach talking to a team of losers have to chase perfection?_\nBut the pursuit of perfection was one of Lombardi’s principles. He didn’t care about the team’s record, he didn’t care about its inexperience, and he didn’t care about what he “should” say as head coach.\n**He cared about helping his players become the best they could possibly be.** \n_That is why he put them through painfully tough practices._\n_That is why he made them show up 15 minutes early for everything._\n_And that is why he kept pushing them even after they became a winning team._\nHe never made decisions based on what others were doing; he made decisions based on deep principles that he developed over a lifetime.\n**Strong principles create strong willpower.** You will face many difficult decisions on the way to your goal.\n_You will have to push yourself when you are tired._\n_You will have to resist when you are tempted._\n_And you will have to sacrifice what you want now, for what you want most._\nBut strong principles will give you the willpower you need to make these tough decisions. They will guide and motivate you to reach your destination, even when the path is treacherous. \\[[3](http://www.amazon.com/Willpower-Instinct-Self-Control-Works-Matters-ebook/dp/B005ERIRZE/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1417781551&sr=8-1&keywords=the+willpower+instinct)\\]\n**So determine your principles, and _never_ compromise them.**\n### **3.   HE MADE SACRIFICES**\n_“The beginning of the week he’s very tense…I don’t see him Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday at all. It must be very hard to do what he needs to do, and to do it alone.” – Marie Lombardi_\nThe untold story of Vince Lombardi is the terrible toll his work took on his personal life. \nThroughout the course of his career he spent as many waking hours as possible coaching. His mind was always on the team, the result from last week, and the upcoming opponent they were facing this week. \nHis mind was so focused on the game, in fact, that sometimes he would get home from work and _try to get into the wrong house!_\n**This focus on football meant his personal life suffered.** \nHe wasn't able to be the great husband and father that he wanted to be. This caused a lot of pain to his family, but ultimately they accepted the fact that Vince was destined to be a legendary football coach - and that path required sacrifices.\n**Whatever greatness you seek, understand that it requires sacrifices.** For Lombardi, that sacrifice was his family's happiness. He probably should never have become a husband and father given what his true priorities were. \nYou will probably not have to make as big of a sacrifice to accomplish what you want in life, but be sure you know what's truly at stake. **You do not have an endless supply of willpower.** Trying to \"do it all\" is a sure recipe for disaster. \\[[4](http://www.psy.lu.se/upload/psykologi/pdf/strength_model1.pdf)\\]\nSo set your priorities and be prepared make sacrifices.\n## **CONCLUSION**\nVince Lombardi was a football genius. But it was not his genius that made him a football legend - it was his willpower. Those who are unable to reach their dreams are not always the ones who fail.\nMore often it is those who stop pushing and settle for \"good\". Those who begin to compromise their principles and make decisions based on what others are doing. And those who are unwilling to make the hard sacrifices necessary to achieve excellence. \nSo ask yourself, are you willing to commit to excellence?\n[\\*Sources](/s/Lombardi.pdf)",

      "content": "When he was 12 years old, Kobe Bryant was about to give up basketball forever. **He just completed his summer basketball camp and was going home a disgrace.**\nHe thought it would be the beginning of a flawless journey to becoming the star NBA player that we all know today – especially because his father, [Joe Bryant,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Bryant) played in the [NBA](http://www.nba.com/) for 8 years before playing his final 6 years in Italy.\nDuring those 6 years in Italy, the Bryant family fully embraced the culture. This included Kobe playing soccer for most of his youth and showing a lot of promise in the sport.\nBut in the summer of 1991, his family moved back to America and Kobe finally had a chance to play his father’s favorite game.\nHe entered the camp and played against some of the most talented youngsters in the country – and they embarrassed him. **Bryant did not score a single point. Not one jumper, not one layup, not even one free throw. Nothing.** \\[[1](http://www.theplayerstribune.com/kobe-passes-jordan/)\\]\n## **THE TURNING POINT**\nHe spent that entire summer in frustration – questioning whether basketball was really for him. He was, after all, a promising soccer player – _so why dream of becoming a basketball player when he clearly had no talent for it?_\nThen Kobe read about one of his heroes, [Michael Jordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Jordan). He learned how Michael got cut from his high school basketball team, but didn’t quit. Getting cut motivated Michael to outwork everyone around him to prove his coach wrong.\n**When Kobe learned this, a fire was created inside of him that would never be put out.** He wanted to work harder than everyone else for the rest of his basketball career – and he did.\n## **THE WILL OF KOBE BRYANT**\nWhen Kobe entered high school, he got to the gym every day at 5am and would not leave the afternoon practice until 7pm! \nAfter the official practice was over, he convinced his teammates to play one-on-one games with him up to 100 points.\nHe singled out any player that could help him improve his skills and forced them to challenge him.\n**This relentless work ethic over his high school career turned him into one of the best players in the country.** So good, in fact, that just 6 years after he failed to score a single point in basketball camp, Kobe was drafted 13th overall in the NBA.\nBut his work ethic didn’t stop there. He pushed himself even harder as an NBA player.\nHe practiced by himself, _sometimes even without a ball_, hours before his teammates showed up to the gym.\nHe forced himself to make 400 shots every single practice. He put himself through 4 hours of intense workouts _on game days!_\nHe completely cut out sugar and had one of the strictest diets in the NBA.\nAnd he continued to force teammates to stay after practice to face him one-on-one.\nSome NBA players love to play under the bright lights of the arena, but Kobe Bryant loved to put in the work before the lights even came on – then stay long after they were turned off. \\[[2](http://www.businessinsider.com/17-examples-of-kobe-bryants-insane-work-ethic-2013-8)\\]\n**All of this work led Kobe to become one of the greatest basketball players of all time.** All of which happened despite the fact that, as a 12-year old, he showed the least amount of promise of _anyone_ in that basketball camp!\nClearly it was not innate talent that helped Kobe Bryant reach his extraordinary success_,_ it was his sheer ferocity of will.\n## **PROOF THAT SUCCESS IS IN YOUR CONTROL**\nThis proves that if someone followed Kobe Bryant’s path, he could reach the same level of success.\nThere is nothing preventing another boy entering his first year of high school from getting to the gym at 5am and practicing until 7pm.\nThere is nothing stopping him from recognizing areas of weakness in his game and working relentlessly to improve them.\nThere is nothing stopping him from following a strict diet, or doing intense 4-hour workouts on game days.\nNor is there anything stopping him from meticulously counting 400 made shots every single day.\nAll of these practices are _within the control of anyone._ Which means achieving the level of success of Kobe Bryant is also _within the control of anyone!_\n**So why aren’t more people as successful as Kobe Bryant?**\nBecause following his path is hard, [painful](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/pain-is-temporary), and [boring](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/embrace-boredom). It requires something more than simply knowing what to do. It requires the one thing that truly separates those who achieve greatness from everyone else – willpower.\n## **HOW TO DEVELOP KOBE BRYANT’S WILLPOWER**\nUnlike almost everything else in life, your willpower is something that you have complete control over. You cannot control your circumstances, your luck, or other people in your life.\n**But you can control your decisions and your actions.** \nAnd ultimately that is what Kobe Bryant did to achieve his extraordinary success. So let’s unpack Kobe’s story to see how he was able to develop the willpower to become one of the greatest basketball players of all time.\n## **1.**    **FIND A HERO**     \n[Heroes](http://www.willpowered.co/the-will-of-heroes) have the ability to inspire you in ways you may not think. Your brain responds differently when it is given a story about somebody than when it is given simple principles or best practices.\n**When you read about someone, your brain will visualize you in his or her shoes.** \\[[3](http://www.nips.ac.jp/fmritms/conference/references/Mano/Zwann1998PB.pdf)\\]\nIf someone told 12 year-old Kobe that he could become a great basketball player if he just “outworks everyone” it would not have [inspired](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/inspiration-will-enhance-your-willpower) him in the same way.\nBut because he read the story about Michael Jordan, he could see himself in Michael’s shoes. He could see himself outworking everyone else and see it leading him to the same success.\nThis gave Kobe more “[Want Power](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/want-power)” - the most powerful form of willpower we have. It gives us the ability to keep pushing ourselves because we know that the sacrifices will be worth it. \\[[4](http://www.amazon.com/Willpower-Instinct-Self-Control-Works-Matters-ebook/dp/B005ERIRZE/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1415642918&sr=1-1&keywords=the+willpower+instinct)\\]\n**Seek out your own hero.** Learn their inspirational story and allow yourself to believe that their success is possible for you too.\n## **2.**    **MAKE SACRIFICES** \n> “There’s a choice that we have to make as people…We can all become masters of our craft, but you have to make a choice. What I mean by that is the inherent sacrifices that come along with that. Being a great friend, son, nephew, there are sacrifices that come along with making that choice.” \n> \\- Kobe Bryant\nOne of the biggest mistakes that people make with their willpower is not focusing it on what matters most to them. You use the same [stock of willpower](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/willpower-is-a-muscle) to go to the gym, to stay late at the office, and to resist dessert. \\[[5](http://www.psy.lu.se/upload/psykologi/pdf/strength_model1.pdf)\\]\nKobe achieved greatness because he focused his willpower on one goal – becoming a great basketball player. And he understood that he had to make sacrifices to reach that goal.\nSo he wasn’t a great husband, a great son, or a great friend. This certainly is sad, but in the end he was able to achieve what he really wanted in life. \n**Be prepared to make sacrifices.** It may not be necessary to give up as much as Kobe did, but you will have to sacrifice things you want, for what you want most.\n## **3.**   **BE RELENTLESS**\nIn his last year of high school, Kobe Bryant was unquestionably the best player in the country. This could have made him arrogant. It could have made him believe that the hard work was behind him and now he could take it easy.\n**But he was relentless.**\nWhen he got to the NBA, he worked even harder. After winning his first championship in 2000, he didn't rest on his laurels, he kept working to get better. Then led his team to win 2 more in a row after that.\nIn 2008 after losing to the Boston Celtics in the NBA Finals, he was seen practicing in the gym after the game was over. Then he led the Lakers to win the next 2 championships in a row.\nAt the 2012 Olympics, although he was 34 years-old and playing for a country that was almost guaranteed to win, **he still showed up at the practice facility** _**7 hours before the official practice even started****!**_ \\[[6](https://www.reddit.com/r/nba/comments/19o38z/hi_rnba_my_name_is_robert_and_im_an_athletic)\\]\nEven today, after 3 years of season-ending injuries and playing for a team with almost no chance of winning a championship, he is still fighting. Because Kobe knows that greatness is about always doing your best. No matter what. \n**Whatever \"greatness\" is to you, pursue it relentlessly.** No matter what you accomplish, no matter how far you’ve come, you will always have the ability to be even better tomorrow than you are today. And that is where true greatness lies.\n## **Conclusion**\nKobe Bryant is living proof that achieving greatness does not require talent, circumstances, or luck. It requires a desire to be the best you possibly can and a will to do whatever it takes to get there.\nIt all started by becoming inspired by a hero, making sacrifices for what he truly wanted, and relentlessly pursuing it for his entire career. After researching Kobe's story, I can genuinely say he is one of my greatest heroes. And an inspiration to anyone who is willing to do whatever it takes.\n[\\*Sources](/s/Kobe.pdf)",
