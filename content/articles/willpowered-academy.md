I was standing in the gym in early February, 2013. **It was empty.**
That was not the case one month earlier. In fact, _I could hardly move there were so many people!_
Each one of them with enthusiasm. Each one of them with ambition. And each one of them with the hope that 2013 is the year that they finally summon the willpower to become the person that they truly want to be.
_The person who is fit._
_The person who is healthy._
_**The person who creates a goal and sticks with it.**_
Yet there I stood. Looking around at the empty treadmills, empty bikes and empty benches; only seeing merely a handful of people who are regular exercisers.
It was then that it hit me. **It shouldn’t be this way.**
These were good people. These were people who wanted more out of life. They had ambition and good intentions, but when it came down to it, they just didn’t have the willpower to stick to their plans.
I had been studying and implementing the [science of willpower](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/willpower-is-a-muscle) for years at this point. So I knew how simple and effective the techniques were. **I knew how valuable they could be to someone who just needed to summon the strength to stick to their goal _today._**
Then an idea popped into my head:
“_What if I could create a place where people could learn about and actually strengthen their willpower without having to go through the years of research and experimentation that I have?”_
I wanted to create a [Willpower Academy](http://academy.willpowered.co/)**.**
## **A LONG JOURNEY**
A lot has happened since that day.
I have spent 2 more years researching and experimenting with concepts within the science of willpower.
I started [teaching](http://www.willpowered.co/speaking) the science of willpower in person to as many people as I possibly could. Doing speeches and teaching classes.
Then I started [this blog](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/) which has grown to over 30,000 subscribers from all over the world. (_Every major continent has at least 1,000 Willpowered subscribers!_)
So I decided to create [an online class](http://academy.willpowered.co/courses/master-your-willpower) that would allow me to teach the science of willpower to people no matter where they were in the world!
When I launched that class, I could not believe the reception that I received. People from all over the world have signed up and strengthened their willpower to overcome procrastination, create great habits and live healthier and happier lives.
**And after each of these small wins, my dream from that day on 2013 has finally come to life.**
Today I am launching [Willpowered Academy](http://academy.willpowered.co/). An online school that is dedicated to scientifically strengthening your willpower no matter what your goals and dreams may be.
It will include books, training, classes and resources from some of the top industry experts.
We are still in the beginning stages, but soon we will cover all of the major categories of willpower - exercise, productivity, dieting, studying, sticking to a budget and, of course, procrastination.
**Whatever you use your willpower for, we will create resources for you to strengthen it.**
## **CONCLUSION**
Creating a Willpower Academy has been my dream since first looking upon that empty gym in 2013. This is just the beginning, but today marks a big "[small win](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/small-wins-and-systems)" in helping that dream come to life.
I firmly believe that your future is created by what you decide to do today. And I believe that **what you do today is determined by whether or not you have the willpower to do what is right.**
With the launch of Willpowered Academy, we are one step closer to strengthening the willpower of the world - one person at a time.
