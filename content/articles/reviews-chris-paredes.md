Through the stories of struggle, perseverance and triumph of the world's greatest minds in different fields, I was able to relate to and grasp key concepts of willpower to help understand the drivers behind my actions.
Most importantly, though, this book does an amazing job of demonstrating, through the example of 12 incredibly successful human beings, how belief in oneself, grit, and the vision or purpose one sets forth in their path ties into willpower, and how it can be used as a most valuable tool to overcome any challenge or hardship.
