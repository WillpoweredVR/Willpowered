_"Have I told you that story about how Charlie Parker became [Charlie Parker](http://www.cmgww.com/music/parker/home.html)? Parker's a young kid, pretty good on the sax. Gets up to play at a cutting session… and he (screws) it up...and he's laughed off-stage. Cries himself to sleep that night._
_But the next morning, what does he do? He practices. And he practices and he practices with one goal in mind: Never to be laughed at again._
_And a year later, he goes back to the Reno... And he steps up on that stage and he plays the best solo the world has ever heard._
_So imagine if Jones had just said: 'Well, that's okay Charlie. Eh... that was alright. Good job.' Then Charlie thinks to himself, 'Well, I did do a pretty good job.' End of story, no 'Bird.' That, to me, is... an absolute tragedy._
_There are no two words in the English language more harmful... Than 'good job.'"_
I was floored when I heard [JK Simmons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Simmons) say those words in his Oscar-winning performance in the 2014 movie, _[Whiplash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whiplash_\(2014_film)_.
That speech completely [changed my perspective](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/frame-of-reference) on how to become truly great in my field. I think about it probably once per week, and whenever I do it gives me a rush of willpower to keep pushing and [never settle](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/perseverance) for "good enough."
That is the power of inspiration you can get from a movie.
## **INSPIRATION FROM MOVIES**
I've been writing a lot recently about the [power of stories](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/use-stories-to-inspire-action). And another place you can look for that inspirational power is from movies.
Whiplash is my personal favorite because it shows the grittier side to the pursuit of excellence. Rather than show the "ra ra" speeches, it shows the sacrifices. However, like any piece of art, you may see it completely differently.
So I wanted to see which movies others use as their source of inspiration. To do this, I reached out to fellow writers from around the world to see which movies inspire them and why.
Here are their favorites. I hope they fuel your willpower as well!

### **Sam Thomas Davies**
_Writer and Researcher at [SamuelThomasDavies.com](http://www.samuelthomasdavies.com/) (Sweden)_
**Movie:** [Rush](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1979320/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1)
[![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5416af3ce4b0f910e3133ead/1467207311059-HQ81W9HFQ5IVQ75FXBZR/image-asset.jpeg?format=original)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1979320/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1)
**Summary:** Centered on the rivalry between Formula 1 drivers James Hunt and Niki Lauda during the 1976 Formula One motor-racing season, Rush is a pedal-to-the-metal blockbuster that will leave you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. The rise and fall (and rise) of Niki Lauda is what inspires me most. I won't spoil it, but his comeback is one that reminds us that we already have everything we need to be anything we want.
**Favorite quote:** _"__A wise man can learn more from his enemies than a fool from his friends." -_ _Niki Lauda_

### **Patrik Edblad**
_Writer, mental trainer & personal coach at [Selfication.com](http://www.selfication.com/) (Sweden)_
**Movie:** [Remember the Titans](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0210945/?ref_=nv_sr_1)
**Summary:** The true story of how African American coach Herman Boone controversially is made head coach over the highly successful white coach Bill Yoast at T.C. Williams High School, Virginia. This movie always gives me a rush of inspiration because of all its amazing scenes where the young black and white players learn how to look past their differences and work together as a team. If you're looking for a touching movie with plenty of inspirational moments and have somehow missed Remember the Titans, now is the time to go see it!

**Favorite quote:** _"This is where they fought the battle of Gettysburg. Fifty thousand men died right here on this field, fighting the same fight that we are still fighting among ourselves today. This green field right here, painted red, bubblin' with the blood of young boys. Smoke and hot lead pouring right through their bodies. Listen to their souls, men. I killed my brother with malice in my heart. Hatred destroyed my family. You listen, and you take a lesson from the dead. If we don't come together right now on this hallowed ground, we too will be destroyed, just like they were. I don't care if you like each other of not, but you will respect each other. And maybe... I don't know, maybe we'll learn to play this game like men." -_ _Coach Boone_

### **Niklas Goeke**
_Chief Book Nerd at [Four Minute Books](http://fourminutebooks.com/) (Germany)_
**Movie:** [Unbroken](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1809398/?ref_=nv_sr_1)
[![](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5416af3ce4b0f910e3133ead/1467208061505-EUTLN2ZDZO023PFQ8QNO/image-asset.jpeg?format=original)](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1809398/?ref_=nv_sr_1)
**Summary:** Watching Louis Zamperini survive plane crashes, shark attacks, starvation, torture and the most inhuman conditions thanks to his prepared body and unbreakable spirit leaves me empowered every time. Based on true events, you can't help but think: "If a normal guy like Louis can do this, I sure can solve my problem." If you ever need the willpower to make it through a stretch of discipline and hard work, this movie will give you the boost you need.
**Favorite q ha hauote:** _If you can take it, you can make it. - Louis Zamperini_

### **Miguel Guzman Miranda**
_Personal development coach & writer at [Exito-personal.com](http://www.exito-personal.com/) (Spain)_
**Movie:** [The 13th Warrior](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0120657/)
**Summary:** Vikings tales evoke strength, honor and willpower. In this adventure each of the warriors stands for one of the qualities that comprise [the will of heroes.](http://www.willpowered.co/the-will-of-heroes?ref=in-text)

Edgtho artfully applies his smarts and cunning; Herger takes all challenges always with joy, an uplifting smile and a playful joke; Helfdane stands proud even in the face of death; Ahmed intelligently adapts to survive and thrive; and most of them all Buliwyf (Beowulf) who fights against all odds until the very end.
Will you join the warriors?
**Favorite quote:**
Ahmed Ibn Fahdian: (Given a Viking sword) _"I cannot lift this."_
Herger the Joyous: _"Grow stronger."_

**Summary:** Underdogs can win- Erin didn’t have much going for her other than her strong willpower and determination. She didn’t have a law degree, she wasn’t an investigator and she didn’t “look the part." But she didn’t care what others thought and in the end, she proved them all wrong.
**Favorite quote:** _“If you follow your heart, if you listen to your gut, and if you extend your hand to help another, not for any agenda, but for the sake of humanity, you are going to find the truth.” - Erin Brockovich_

**Summary:** Fight Club is a reminder that at any time you can choose to change your life. In an instant you can decide and do the thing you always wanted. You can be the person you always wanted to be. You don't need permission.
