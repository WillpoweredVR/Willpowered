A must-read if you're looking to make massive change and/or become a master of your craf!
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐  
[Review by Katrina Ravazzi](https://www.amazon.com/Will-Heroes-Greatness-Robertson-2016-02-26/dp/B01FKT2WKQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_product_top?ie=UTF8)
I highly recommend The Will of Heroes. For one, the book demonstrates powerful lessons through interesting and engaging stories from the world's top performers.
But beyond simply telling the stories of how incredible those people are, the book breaks down WHY they were successful and how you can use the same exact strategies that they do.
Colin does a great job of backing his action steps with science, it's like a self-help book backed by legit research. If you're looking to make massive change or become a master of your craft, you should grab this book!
