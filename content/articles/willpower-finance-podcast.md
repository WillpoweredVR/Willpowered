## Summary
In this week’s episode we take a slight detour from our usual programming of trading topics and instead explore the topic of Willpower with Colin Robertson.
Colin’s a willpower researcher, founder of a blog called [willpowered.co](http://willpowered.co/), and if you’re interested in the topic of willpower then I think this episode will give you some real practical insights on the subject.
One of the often cited studies we discuss on the show is the infamous [marshmallow test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_marshmallow_experiment) which showed that young children who were able to delay gratification later grew up to become more successful and happier adults.
So the big question is whether willpower is something we’re born with or can it be developed?
The good news is that willpower can be strengthened like a muscle and we can increase our willpower if we commit to training our brain to be able to exert more willpower regularly.
Meditation has been shown to be one of the most powerful ways to increase willpower.
Research on this subject indicates that three hours of meditation increases self-control and ability to focus and after eleven hours of mediation practice one can see visible changes in the brains.
If you’re curious about meditation then check out our [28 Day Mindfulness for Traders Challenge](http://cnzbjse8.megaph.com/).
It’s a guided meditation program specifically for traders. Dozens of traders have now gone through the challenge and many traders have noted improved levels of concentration and memory, increased energy and stamina, and reduced stress and anxiety.
