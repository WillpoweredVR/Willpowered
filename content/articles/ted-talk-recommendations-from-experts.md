Our mission in starting [Educo Community](https://educocommunity.com?wvideo=9hb9bbfdzo) was simple – **create a platform where expert ideas could be heard.**
But in a noisy world how do you define who is an “expert”?
Knowing full well that we weren’t the experts on this topic (see what I did there?) we turned to an organization who is known around the world for selecting great experts – TED.
We started working with TED and TEDx experts to create actionable, step-by-step online programs that help people put [their advice into action](https://educocommunity.com/p/how-it-works/?ref=navbar).
In recent years, the popularity of TED and TEDx talks has skyrocketed.
But it is not just the general population who has found these talks interesting, inspiration, and helpful...
**The experts themselves have their own favorites.**
Here are 20 TED Talk recommendations from the experts themselves.

Dr. Bushman recommends: [The Surprising Decline in Violence | Steven Pinker](https://www.ted.com/talks/steven_pinker_on_the_myth_of_violence)
"Because it is so counter intuitive. Most people think that violence levels are increasing rather than decreasing. After all, modern weapons can kill a lot more people than sticks and stones."

"One of my favorite TED Talks is from Brian Little, a personality psychologist from Cambridge. Dr. Little uses his sharp, introverted wit to explain why it's important to understand and embrace your personality traits, but he cautions we should not be defined by a personality. We have the power to change our stories when the need arises."

"My favorite Ted Talk is by Shawn Achor. I loved his talk because of his humor, demeanor and relatable stories. I felt like he had tangible takeaways and a message everybody desires. I like to feel like I can find that connection with a speaker right away and he does that so beautifully through his child story."

"My favorite Ted Talk is the one by Amy Cuddy because there is a lot of controversy surrounding that study in psychology. She does a great job and it is engaging but also a great example of how science is changing and what she says in that talk is now (barely 5 years later) found to be inaccurate."

"We all spend so much of our lives letting our mind and worries control our lives. Think of the thousands of hours we waste reliving past experiences we can't change and worrying about future 'what if's' that may never happen. When we can practice Isabelle Mercier's H.E.R.O factor it will free our minds and hearts to fly, to be happy and live our purpose."

Ruben Meerman, _Author and Television Host_
Ruben recommends: [How I Held My Breath for 17 Minutes | David Blaine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XFnGhrC_3Gs)
"My favourite TED talk is by David Blaine because his stunts are real and they make us wonder about how our own bodies work. Most people really could learn to hold their breath for 17 minutes and because two thirds of us are overweight or obese, nearly everyone can survive without food for 44 days. It’s amazing but ultimately just biochemistry, which, in my opinion, is the nearest thing to real magic."

"I love Brene Brown's TED talk 'The Power of Vulnerability.' There are no courageous actions without vulnerability. So it's an essential skill for any leader to master. This TED talk explains what vulnerability is and how to put it into practice in your own life."

I think those links are often neglected and not yet well understood. His work on using mirror therapy was compelling in its elegant simplicity."

Isabelle recommends: [How Great Leaders Inspire Action | Simon Sinek](https://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action)
" At the risk of being very cliché, my favorite TEDx talk would be How Great Leaders Inspire Action by Simon Sinek… I love the way he presents and explains his point of view. He is engaging and massively inspiring while keeping it so simple. He always uses examples that are easy to understand…and has a way to seduce you to somehow agree with him. He is passionately skillful…and that inspires me."
Isabelle also recommends _(because she couldn't decide on just one!)_: [The Magic of Not Giving a F\*\*\* | Sarah Knight](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GwRzjFQa_Og)
"It’s short, it’s simple and super funny. Saying NO is one of the hardest things to do for most people…yet…this 2 letter word can create so much freedom. My partner and I live by design…rather than by default and this TEDx talk supports our beliefs and daily actions."

You can learn about anything from the power of being vulnerable, to leadership, to [the proper way to tie your shoes](https://www.ted.com/talks/terry_moore_how_to_tie_your_shoes).
But none of this expert knowledge will make a difference if you do not put it into practice.
