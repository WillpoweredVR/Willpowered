For the fourth episode, I want to share with you a podcast interview I did about a year ago when I had just come up with the idea that would turn into Educo Community as it is today.
The podcast interview is with Rajiv Nathan and Martin McGovern– the cofounders of [Idea Lemon](http://www.idealemon.com/podcasts/). An organization dedicated to helping people make their ideas a reality.
We talked about how to find meaning in work, finding the right metrics of success, and an idea I had for “Reverberation” which became [Educo Community](http://educocommunity.com).
