[Review by Ben Austin](http://bit.ly/reviews-ben-austin)
If you liked Robert Greene's Mastery, or Malcolm Gladwell's Blink you're going to LOVE The Will Of Heroes!
Most "success" type books are completely terrible and just regurgitate old information in a new way. This book is different.
The Will of Heroes breaks down the science of why some people achieve their dreams and most of us don't. The book is a masterclass in developing your own iron-clad willpower, which you can use to achieve any goal.
