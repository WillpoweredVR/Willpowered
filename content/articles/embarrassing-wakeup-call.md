The day was moving along like usual.
Wake up at 5...[healthy breakfast](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/what-to-eat-for-breakfast)...[meditation](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/benefits-of-meditation-on-willpower)...and - [as planned](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/finish-kickstarter-strong) - forcing myself to "[eat my frog](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/eat-the-frog-first)" and reach out to others.
**But once again, reaching out to bloggers, friends, and the press just felt wrong.**
So over the next few hours, I was questioning why reaching out always felt "icky".
Then - also as planned - I had another meditation session in the afternoon to make up for lost sleep. **Then** **the idea hit me like a ton of bricks****.**
_I am thinking about myself way too much!_
With every person I reach out to, with every social media post, and with every place I try to market the Kickstarter, I am asking the question:
_How can I get this person to do what I want?_
## **Change in attitude**
Well, maybe I haven't been quite that selfish. **But I’m really only thinking about how I can reach my goal**. And I failed to open my eyes to the thousands of others out there that are exactly like me!
I never thought about all of the others who are hoping that some online influencer will help them share their own dream with the world.
_Bloggers..._
_YouTubers...._
_Musicians..._
Even within Kickstarter there are thousands of people who are in the same struggle as I am - struggling to make their dream become a reality.
**So my willpower challenge will be to use my knowledge of willpower, writing, and building an online community to help others who are truly dedicated.**
Not because I am looking to get something out of them, but because right now what I need most is the support of others who truly believe in the [work I am doing.](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/743524537/the-will-of-heroes/)
_So why not be that person for someone who needs me as much as I need them?_
## **The plan OF ACTION**
This is outside of my [comfort zone](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/learning-zone), so it will require using some willpower to do it.
Therefore, I will do myself a big favor by [making pre-loaded decisions](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/decisions-waste-willpower) about exactly what I need to do - reducing the chance that I'll procrastinate.
_So here's the plan..._
1.  **Focus on teaching, not selling.** Maintain the [proper perspective](http://www.willpowered.co/learn/joe-desena-unbreakable-will) of helping others in my situation - not secretly wondering how I can get them to help me.
2.  **Subscribe to at least 3 blogs and send them genuine emails of praise.** I'm embarrassed by how little I do this. I owe it to the community to support them more.
3.  **Review at least 3 Kickstarter projects and back any I believe in.** These people are fighting for their dreams and they deserve at least 5 minutes to learn about them.
4.  **Answer 3 questions on forums.** I use forums so often when I have questions, yet I never provide any answers.
5.  **Continue to thoughtfully answer every subscriber email.** This is possible because of you! I am deeply grateful for your support and will do all I can to help you.
Now, this plan isn't going to make me the online Mother Theresa. But I've finally woken up to how self-serving I've been.
This is a realistic step in the right direction to making more connections, and hopefully making an impact - no matter how small.
_I promise to do better for readers, dreamers, and the online community!_
## **RESULTS:**
-   **What we needed today** to reach our goal: $433
-   **What we raised today** from 4 backers**:** **$201**
-   **Key learning:** Support others, but be genuine (people can tell!)
-   **Key takeaway for tomorrow:** Reach out to more writers/bloggers I truly admire.
# **Time to do better!**
