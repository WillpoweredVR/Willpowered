Today I am joined by Shauna Shapiro. Shauna is a professor, author, and internationally recognized expert in mindfulness. She has over 20 years of studying meditation in Thailand, Nepal, and the West.
She has also published 150 Journal articles and chapters and co-authored the critically acclaimed texts, "The Art and Science of Mindfulness," as well as "Mindful Discipline: A Loving Approach to Setting Limits and Raising an Emotionally Intelligent Child."
Today she and I talk about how mindfulness applies to personal development, to education, to the corporate world, and to parenting.
